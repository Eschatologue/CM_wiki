## History

### The Great Split

During The Great Split, Sri, found THEMSELVES drawn into the midst of a devastating conflict between the Elven Empire and the expanding forces of London. The war, long and brutal, had reached a stalemate, with London gaining the upper hand and seizing control of the majority of territories once held by the Elves.

In a desperate bid for salvation, the Elves turned to Sri. Moved by their wish, Sri bestow THEIR gaze upon the Elves, granting them the ability to draw upon the endless cosmic weave that flowed throughout the continent. For a brief moment, the tide of war turned in favor of the Elves, as they unleashed their newfound abilities upon the forces of London.

However, amidst the chaos of battle, peace negotiations were underway, with diplomats from both sides striving to broker an end to the conflict. The sudden surge of power granted by Sri disrupted the delicate balance of negotiations, leading to their abrupt breakdown. The Elves, intoxicated by their newfound strength, refused to yield, insisting on pressing their advantage against London.

In the end, the brief blessing bestowed by Sri proved to be a double-edged sword. While it granted the Elves a temporary reprieve from the onslaught of London's forces, it also shattered any hopes of reconciliation and peace. In a final act of desperation, London launched a devastating bombardment on the Tree of Life itself, bringing an end to Sri's influence and sealing the fate of the once-great Elven Empire.
