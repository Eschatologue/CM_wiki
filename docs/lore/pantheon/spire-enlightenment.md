*"If THEY come back, I'm betting we're toast—and honestly, we'd deserve it after the magical mess we've made."* <br><p align="right">– Young Gallian Scholar </p>

## Overview

The **Spire of Enlightenment**, associated with the Goliath named **Antero Vipunen**. It is one of the most significant and mysterious entities in Antares. The exact status of this Spire remains unknown, but its influence is universally acknowledged through its embodiment in the Weave, the foundation of all magic. 

While various cultures dispute the origins of spellcasting—the elves asserting their ancestors invented it, and the Gallians and Tartessians claiming to have perfected it—all agree that the true source of magic is deeply tied to Antero Vipunen and Antares' History.

## Appearance

In historical accounts, **Antero Vipunen** is described as an exceptionally large Goliath, towering even among their kin. Details about THEIR physical appearance are scarce, but it is widely accepted that upon THEIR ascension, Antero Vipunen shed THEIR mortal form entirely. Following this transformation, THEY are believed to exist solely as the Weave itself. Poetic traditions often describe the Weave as being composed of THEIR flesh and bones, binding the fabric of reality together.

## History

**Antero Vipunen** was a Goliath shaman renowned for unparalleled knowledge of magic, including spells and rituals predating even creation itself. THEY travelled extensively across Antares, imparting THEIR teachings to the Ancients. These teachings are considered pivotal in the survival of Antares, as they formed the foundation of the arcane arts.

During the catastrophic First Maelstorm, the arcane foundations of the world were shattered, threatening to obliterate reality. In response, Antero Vipunen made the ultimate sacrifice, intertwining THEIR essence with the remnants of magic to create a new, permanent Weave. This act not only stabilised the world but ensured the continuity of magic as a permanent and immutable force. Through this sacrifice, Antero Vipunen ascended to Spirehood, becoming a symbol of enlightenment and the cornerstone of magic we know today.
