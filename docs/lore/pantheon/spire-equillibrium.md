# Spire of Equillibrium

## Overview

The **Spire of Equilibrium**, presided over by **Trutinius**, is the embodiment of balance and order within Antares. While the exact nature of its influence remains elusive, its effects are undeniable. Subtle shifts in natural laws, the behaviour of living beings, and principles are often attributed to the unseen hand of the Equilibrium. Scholars interpret these phenomena as corrections intended to preserve the delicate balance of reality.

## Appearance

Accounts of **Trutinius** describe THEM as a constantly shifting construct, resembling a complex mechanism or interface. Glowing glyphs and symbols, manifest across THEIR incomprehensible form. The Spire's presence alone seems to actively correct the imbalances of the universe. Observers frequently compare THEIR form to a dynamic, self-correcting poetry or any written media, with each element—letters, plots, and parts—actively changing to suit whatever the Spire deems as balanced.

## History

The origins of Trutinius are entirely unknown. The Spire of Equilibrium seemingly has no beginning, it simply came to be, and most of Antares' inhabitants simply accept it as the part of the world since the very beginning. You should too as well, or a certain "balancing act" might befall you.
