## Profile

**Etemenanki**, known as the Spire of Perseverance, embodies qualities of resilience, hope, and sheer will. Followers of Etemenanki adhere to these virtues often with amazing zealotry. This Spire is formed from a combination of many souls and deceased deities, making it one of the most powerful spires known today. As long as there is hope in this [redacted] continent, Etemenanki will endure in perpetuity.

Unlike the primordial gods of old so-called “Ares”, this Spire does not inspire the dumb foolishness of victory in war, but the wisdom and determination to see it through.

#### Other Titles:

- Herald of Hope
- The Steelheart
