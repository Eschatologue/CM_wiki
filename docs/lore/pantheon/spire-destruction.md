## Profile

After the event of the First Warp Maelstrom, Antares continent experienced chaos and destruction on a scale never seen before. From the complete and utter annihilation of its coastlines to its denizens being killed in the ensuing invasions from the Warp, only three-fourths of the population remained, scrambling for survival.

This event was so chaotic that it not only shattered the continent but also shattered the moon, turning the once radiant spherical body in the sky into the ivory arc we see today. This scale of destruction tore a rift in the cosmic weave, giving birth to a Spire known as **Aaraau, The Destruction**.

#### Other Titles

- The Collapsing Star
- Lord of Entropy
- The Witness

## Appearance

There is still a lot of debate about the appearance of Aaraau, but the common consensus often associates THEIR appearance with the celestial arc that now presides over Antares' night sky. Another report suggests that THEY once appeared as a white flaring shooting star in the sky.

The most recent form of Aaraau ever witnessed appeared at the height of the London-Dwarvish war. After London unleashed the dreaded "Excalibur" at the Dwarves' main army, during the fiery pillar that consumed it, survivors of the tragedy witnessed what said to be Aaraau appearing before the destruction as a gargantuan disk of cosmic dust presiding above the catastrophe.
