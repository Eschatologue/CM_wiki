# Technology & Magic

In Antares, or the Crown & Misery setting, technology and magic are not merely parallel constructs; they are intricately compatible, often amplifying each other's potency. However, this bleak world views such progress with suspicion and fear. Many problems are still resolved through brute force and superstition.

Magic is a legacy left by the precursors and was further refined by the Elves of Tähdenvalta and dissected by the spellcasters of Gallia. Together, they forged a singular pathway, guiding Antares from its savage beginnings to its current state of existence. That is, until London arrived.

The total capitulation of Tähdenvalta during the Great Split exposed the world to an entirely different paradigm of civilisational development. The existence of a powerful nation like London, thriving without a trace of arcane influence, challenges the very foundations of understanding. The notion of a civilisation flourishing without magic is as bewildering as the idea of a human surviving without air.

This section delves into the complex relationship between technology and magic in Antares, exploring their origins, societal impacts, and the delicate balance that defines existence in this world. As factions rise and fall, grasping the interplay between these forces becomes essential for anyone seeking to carve out a place in this unforgiving world.

## Origin of Magic

Magic in Antares is woven into the very fabric of reality through a mystical conduit known as the Weave. This network serves as the lifeblood of arcane energies, connecting all living beings and allowing individuals to tap into its vast potential. The Weave embodies the world's intrinsic harmony, reflecting the delicate balance between creation and destruction.

Legends speak of the precursors, ancient beings who first discovered the Weave and learned to manipulate its threads. Through their mastery, they shaped the world and bestowed gifts upon emerging civilizations, creating a thriving era of magic.

As societies flourished, the Weave became increasingly accessible, with scholars and spellcasters delving into its complexities. The Elves of Tähdenvalta emerged as leading practitioners, refining and expanding upon the knowledge passed down from the precursors. Their deep connection to the Weave enabled them to create powerful enchantments and intricate spells.

However, the Weave is sensitive to the emotions and intentions of its wielders. Disruptions can lead to catastrophic magical failures, instilling a sense of fear and caution among the civilisation of Antares. This ambivalence towards magic has, over time, made brute force a preferred solution to the world's problems.

## Advent of Technology

The emergence of London marked a significant moment in the history of Antares, challenging established paradigms. Unlike other civilizations, which relied heavily on the Weave and its interactions upon the physical world, London presented an entirely new model of progress—a world where arcane forces played no role in the advancement of society.

Upon their arrival, the Londoners brought with them a suite of innovations that seemed both alien and revolutionary. Their war machines and tools, powered by a unique blend of engineering and resourcefulness, a complete opposite to the arcane power that had dominated the battlefield for millennia. Rather than harnessing the Weave, these machines relied on complex mechanics, advanced materials, and a keen understanding of physical laws to achieve what once seemed impossible.
