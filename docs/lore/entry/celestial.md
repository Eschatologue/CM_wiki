# The Celestial Language

Celestial is a language of mysterious origin, notorious for its more-than-lethal effects on those who attempt to interpret its meaning. Unlike other confusing language, which merely confounds its readers due to its complex writing system, Celestial poses a direct threat to both mind and body.

## Details

Celestial has a unique form of writing, it consists of complex sigils and pictograms. These symbols are infamous for their dangerous effects on both body and mind. Due to their high flammability, Celestial is often written on steel plates for study, though it can also be chiseled into stone tablets or other flame-retardant materials. 

Some vagrants, capable of writing Celestial either by copying artifacts they stole or through insanity driven by studying these sigils, sometimes commit accidental (or intentional) arson by etching the language onto walls. Such individuals are swiftly dealt with by special law enforcement units dedicated to this crime, present in every nation.

Celestial inscriptions can be found etched on many ruins across the surface and underground sections of Antares. These writings appear on ancient artifacts, tablets, and sometimes books. The pillars of the [Northern Gate](../lore/entry/the-gate.md) bear such inscriptions, and the ruins beneath the Myrkheimr mountains and the Underdark often feature these writings as well.

Little knowledge exists and many rumors surround Celestial. Few dare to study it, often giving it no more than a passing glance. Approaching, reading, and especially comprehending Celestial typically results in severe injuries, ranging from varying degrees of burn wounds and nightmares to insanity and, most often, death.

## Studying Celestial

In every part of the world, there are those who are clever, foolish, or perhaps both, willing to study Celestial! Each nation calls them by different names: Scholars of Correspondence in London, Psykers in Myrkheimr and Valinor, Blemished Ones in Gallia, and Heretics in Soterrano. Despite their different titles, these scholars share a common fate: they tend to randomly combust after studying the language.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity, they will frantically study anything even remotely resembling Celestial. Scholars of various fields often place bets on which of these foolhardy individuals will explode first.

Nonetheless, unsurprisingly, studying Celestial can be difficult even for those with academic experience. Due to its inherent dangers, materials written in Celestial are often confiscated and destroyed. Lengthy discussions regarding Celestial can be extremely lethal to all parties involved; even thinking about Celestial can cause feelings of being scorched. Therefore, common methods of studying the language involve directly examining ruins where the language is inscribed, often while wearing cumbersome protective suits.

One notable invention by London scholars is a device called the "Tinted Glass." Made from classified materials and etched with Celestial sigils, this glass allows for the reading of Celestial with significantly reduced side effects. However, prolonged exposure and speaking the language still carry the same perilous effects.

## Spellings and Grammar

Celestial is still a language, following its own set of rules for spelling, grammar, and structure. However, these rules are shaky at best, forming a jumbled mess that is hard to understand and likely to drive one mad before comprehension is achieved.

Certain sigils or 'letters' in Celestial are well known and often appear within many ruins, while others are seen only once and never again. Some sigils are merely scribbles and poor imitations of the language. A surefire method to determine the significance or importance of a sigil is based on how much they sear the surface they are written on or how quickly they drive the interpreter insane.

Sigils in Celestial are not like letters in Common or Dwarvish, where many letters form a coherent sentence. Instead, they resemble the Tianming writing system, where each character has its own meaning—sometimes a word, sometimes an entire sentence. Even more confusing is that the same sigil can have different meanings depending on its orientation.

Furthermore, sentences composed of Celestial sigils can be hard to define. Just because they are near one another does not always mean they are related. A single sentence can span multiple miles and be spaced far apart. However, only a maximum of four sigils can be written safely on a single surface; five sigils will immediately burst into flames and destroy the surface, six sigils will spontaneously explode, and seven sigils, if somehow possible, will cause an even bigger explosion.
