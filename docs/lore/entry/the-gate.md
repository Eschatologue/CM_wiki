# The Northern Gate

The Northern Gate, commonly referred to as "the Gate," is an ancient structure located near the northern pole of Antares, at the borders of the Teethering Maw. This circular portal/gate is notable for being the primary entry point through which the Londoners arrived on Antares for the first time.

The Northern Gate is rumored to serve as a connection between distant realms or locations separated by great distances. Its exact mechanism and purpose remain largely unknown. Prior to the arrival of the Londoners and the subsequent conflicts, the existence of the Northern Gate was kept secret by the elves who controlled the area. This secrecy was due in part to the Gate's inherent danger; prolonged exposure to its Celestial script and engravings could result in spontaneous combustion, a phenomenon that made the Gate particularly hazardous.

Following the Second Warp Maelstorm, the responsibility for guarding the Northern Gate was largely abandoned. The elves, who had previously maintained a vigilant watch over the Gate, were unable to continue their efforts due to shifting priorities and their eventual defeat by the Londoners. As a result, the Londoners assumed control of the Gateâ€™s protection. They employ a massive airship, known as the "Illustrious" which patrols the surrounding region from a secure distance to prevent unauthorized access. The reasons for the Londoners' continued oversight of the Gate remain classified.

The structure is believed to have been constructed by the Precursors and was likely intended to connect Antares to other continents beyond The Mist Veil. However, the precise function of the Gate and the means by which it operates are beyond the current technological and magical understanding of Antares.

The Gate is the subject of various prophecies and theories, which suggest that uncovering its secrets might provide a means of salvation from the Warp. Its complex design and potential for inter-realm connectivity continue to make it a focal point of interest and speculation.
