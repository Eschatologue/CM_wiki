# Firearms

**Firearms**, also known as **guns** or **gun weapons**, are a class of ranged weaponry that use a propellant to launch projectiles at high speed. They are London’s signature weapon, perfectly suited to their military needs and physical limitations.

## Weaponology

Firearms generally operate using a propellant substance known as 'Cordite,' which drives a projectile—commonly referred to as a bullet—out of the barrel at high velocity. Bullets are typically made from metals such as copper, lead, and iron, with rare variants crafted from Silver or Adamantium. While magical bullets do exist, they are rare and often prohibitively expensive.

The bullet and 'Cordite' are housed within a single package called a **casing**, collectively known as a **cartridge**. The availability of cartridges can be a significant issue; outside London, they are harder to obtain, making firearms less effective without a steady supply. Users often carry extra cartridges, use them sparingly, or train with melee weapons as a backup.

### Defending Against

To defend against firearms, spells from the Abjuration school of magic are most effective. Due to the high velocity of bullets, spellcasters typically activate protective spells upon sighting the weapon rather than waiting for it to fire. Spells that generate intense winds can also alter a bullet’s trajectory, offering additional protection.

## Origins and Impact

Firearms were introduced to Antares by the Londoners, whose industrial prowess and reliance on technological superiority have shaped their dominance. Unlike other weapons, which often rely on magical enhancements or the wielder's skill, firearms derive their power from the weapon itself. This has limited their adoption among other nations, where alternatives like Gallian magic and Myrkheim’s advanced crossbows—dependent on the wielder's abilities—are preferred.

Despite their physical frailty compared to Antares’ native inhabitants, the Londoners’ use of firearms compensates for their weaknesses, providing a crucial advantage and helping secure their dominance in the region.

## Practical Use and Comparison

Firearms in Antares operate on a distinct principle. They use 'Cordite' to propel bullets at high speeds, requiring minimal physical exertion from the user. This makes firearms particularly suitable for Londoners, whose physical constitution is weaker compared to other races.

In contrast, ranged weapons like bows and crossbows rely heavily on the user’s strength and skill. Elvish longbows, known for their range and accuracy, require years of practice and considerable physical strength. Dwarven crossbows, renowned for their tensile strength and materials, also demand significant strength to operate effectively.

Arcane staves harness magical energy to cast spells, dependent on the user's magical proficiency and extensive training. While firearms may not match the raw power of an elvish longbow, the brute force of a dwarven crossbow, or the destructive potential of an arcane staff, they offer practical advantages. They are easy to use, require minimal training, and can be mass-produced, making them an ideal weapon for Londoners and enabling even those with limited physical strength to be effective in combat.
