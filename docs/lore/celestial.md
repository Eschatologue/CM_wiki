# The Celestial Language

Celestial is a language of mysterious origin, notorious for its more-than-lethal effects on those who attempt to interpret its meaning. Unlike Primordial, which merely confounds its readers due to its complex writing system, Celestial poses a direct threat to both mind and body.

Celestial has a unique form of writing, it consists of complex sigils and pictograms. These symbols are infamous for their dangerous effects on both body and mind. Due to their high flammability, Celestial is often written on steel plates for study, though it can also be chiseled into stone tablets or other flame-retardant materials. 

Some vagrants, capable of writing Celestial either by copying artifacts they stole or through insanity driven by studying these sigils, sometimes commit accidental (or intentional) arson by etching the language onto walls. Such individuals are swiftly dealt with by special law enforcement units dedicated to this crime, present in every nation.

Celestial inscriptions can be found etched on many ruins across the surface and underground sections of Antares. These writings appear on ancient artifacts, tablets, and sometimes books. The stone pillars of the Northern Gate bear such inscriptions, and the ruins beneath the Mykrrheim mountains and the Underdark often feature these writings as well.

Little knowledge exists and many rumors surround Celestial. Few dare to study it, often giving it no more than a passing glance. Approaching, reading, and especially comprehending Celestial typically results in severe injuries, ranging from varying degrees of burn wounds and nightmares to insanity and, most often, death.

## Studying Celestial

> "What does 'Out of all, one must pay the price' mean? What price?? I'm not paying taxes to whoever wrote these things! Oh [redacted]! The paper! It's burning!!!" - An Elven Scholar

In every part of the world, there are those who are clever, foolish, or perhaps both, willing to study Celestial! Each nation calls them by different names: Scholars of Correspondence in London, Psykers in Mykrrheim and Valinor, Blemished Ones in Gallia, and Heretics in Soterrano. Despite their different titles, these scholars share a common fate: they tend to randomly combust after studying the language.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity, they will frantically study anything even remotely resembling Celestial. Scholars of various fields often place bets on which of these foolhardy individuals will explode first.

Nonetheless, unsurprisingly, studying Celestial can be difficult even for those with academic experience. Due to its inherent dangers, materials written in Celestial are often confiscated and destroyed. Lengthy discussions regarding Celestial can be extremely lethal to all parties involved; even thinking about Celestial can cause feelings of being scorched. Therefore, common methods of studying the language involve directly examining ruins where the language is inscribed, often while wearing cumbersome protective suits.

One notable invention by London scholars is a device called the "Tinted Glass." Made from classified materials and etched with Celestial sigils, this glass allows for the reading of Celestial with significantly reduced side effects. However, prolonged exposure and speaking the language still carry the same perilous effects.

## [WIP] Spellings and Grammar

Celestial is still a language, it still abide the same rules; it has spelling, grammar, and a structure. But the rules are shaky at best, it is a jumbled mess and hard to understand, likely it will drive ones mad before they understand it.

Certain sigils or 'letter' in celestial are quite well known and often appears within a many ruins, while some is only seen once and never again, and some sigils are sily scribbles and poor imitation of the language. There is a surefire method however to determine how long or how significant or the importance of a sigil is based on how much they sear the surface they written on or how fast it is to make the interpreter go lose its mind. 

Sigils aren't like letters in Common language, or Dwarvish, where many letters forms a coherent sentence, instead they has simmilar style of which of a Tianming writing sysytem, where each character or one character has their own meaning, sometimes a word, sometimes an entire sentence. Even more confusing are though the sigil is the same, they can have different meaning depending on the orientation of the sigil.

Furthermore sentences of Celestial sigils can somtimes be hard to define; just because they are newr to one another can sometimes means they are unrelated to one another, and a sentence can span multiple miles long abd be spaced apart. However, only a maximum of four sigils can be written safetly on a single surface, five sigils immediately burst into flames and destroy the surface, six spontenausly explodes, and seven if somehow possible cause an even bigger explosion.
