# Warp Storms

Warp Storms are a term used to describe the common and cataclysmic natural disasters in Antares.

## Overview

Warp Storms are a combination of multiple disasters, including earthquakes, meteor strikes, thunderstorms, massive typhoons, and coastal tsunamis. However, they are visually distinguished by a tear in the sky, revealing a starless void beyond. Regardless of their specific form, all Warp Storms share two consistent outcomes: the deposition of Voidite Crystals (commonly called Warp Crystals) and the emergence of Warp Entities, also referred to as aberrations. While Voidite Crystals can be removed with relative ease, the aberrations that accompany Warp Storms swarm the affected areas, making survival outside the towering walls of Citadel Cities nearly impossible.

To safeguard against these frequent calamities, nations across Antares employ various methods to detect and prepare for incoming Warp Storms. Advanced nations use highly sophisticated weather prediction systems that monitor the atmospheric anomalies associated with Warp Storms. Other regions rely on psykers trained to sense the approach of a storm, offering varying degrees of accuracy, while some depend on powerful Divination magic. Regardless of the method, these systems provide critical time to fortify city defences and implement disaster relief measures.

Although the initial disasters caused by Warp Storms are often mitigated through training and preparation, the aftermath presents the greatest danger. The storms attract aberrations to the areas they strike, frequently leading to the complete destruction of cities not from the storm itself, but from the relentless assault of Warp Entities that follow.

### Warp Maelstorms

Warp Maelstroms are catastrophes far exceeding the scale of regular Warp Storms. These extinction-level events occur once every several centuries, leaving devastation that reshapes the continent and significantly impacts its inhabitants. The significance of these events is so profound that the Antares calendar system marks the years following each Maelstrom as 'AT' or "Après la Tempête," meaning "After the Storm."

A Warp Maelstrom is not merely a disaster but a near-apocalyptic phenomenon. The last known Maelstrom fractured the continent and almost eradicated all life, ushering in a new era of survival and adaptation. While historical records remain incomplete, current research suggests that at least two Warp Maelstroms have occurred. The first is theorised to have obliterated Antares' precursor civilisation, and the second defines the era in which the current events of Antares unfold.
