# Warp Storms

Warp Storms are a term used to describe the common and cataclysmic natural disasters in Antares.

## Overview
Warp Storms are frequent calamities within Antares, visibly marked by a tear in the sky amidst a void of stars, surrounded by swirling nebulas that replace the usual blue expanse. The immediate side effects often manifest as blizzards, thunderstorms, earthquakes, and occasional meteor showers or tornadoes. Though their forms may vary, they all leave behind dangerous Warp Crystals, which contaminate the affected area when left too long, mutating anything caught within. Given the frequency of Warp Storm occurrences, those seeking survival typically seek refuge behind the fortified walls of Citadel Cities. While cities may still be affected, rapid response efforts usually minimize the damage.

Many nations employ different methods for detecting incoming Warp Storms. Some nations boast highly sophisticated weather prediction systems that measure abnormalities caused by Warp Storms. Others rely on specially trained psykers to detect incoming storms with more-or-less accurate predictions, while some depend on powerful divination magic. Whatever the method, these systems give cities ample time to prepare and bolster their protections and disaster relief procedures.

Despite the potential for inaccuracies, the initial disaster caused by a Warp Storm is usually mitigated efficiently, as all citizens are typically trained to deal with such ordeals. However, the aftermath is what causes the most problems. Warp Storms attract aberrations outside the city walls, often resulting in entire cities being lost not due to the disaster itself but to the relentless onslaught of Warp Entities that follows. 

Inaccuracies in storm prediction do happen from time to time, leading to false alarms that can cause the populace to riot. For example, in Gallia, an entire institution was beheaded for such a mistake, a decision from which the nation never recovered.

## [WIP] Warp Maelstorm
Not to be confused by regular Warp Storms, Warp Maelstorms are basically Warp Storms at a scale far more significant than regular Storms, they happen only once in several centuries though the damage they do can be felt for much longer and their significance are even marked in Antares calendar system as 'AT' or 'Après la Tempête' or After the Storm to mark years after such catasthrope. 

To say the Maelstorm was a tragedy would be an understatement, as it is a literal extinction event that fractured the continent and almost caused an actual extinction. There is much debate on how many Warp Maelstorm occurs accross antares history, but the current research theorized there is already a first one that erased Antares precursors civlisation and the second one which where the current story takes place.
