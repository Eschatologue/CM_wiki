# Entities

Warp Entities is a collective term for the various extradimensional beings that roam the wilderness of Antares, as well as those influenced by these entities. Commonly referred to as aberrations, demons, or wraiths, the specific names vary across different nations and languages.

## Overview

Beyond the protective walls of Citadel Cities, the wilderness of Antares teems with Warp Entities, posing a constant threat to anyone who ventures out. These entities are byproducts of common Warp Storms, hence their name "Warp Entities." Their appearances vary widely, from humanoids covered in crystalline growths to grotesque forms resembling structures of limbs and eyes, black, foggy, formless bodies, twisted versions of machines, and some even possessing psionic abilities. The most powerful of them can warp space and time.

### Day and Night Behaviour

Warp Entities exhibit different behaviors depending on the time of day. During the day, they are typically in a "neutral" state, attacking only when provoked. However, in the evening and especially at night, these creatures become highly aggressive and coordinated, often resulting in the deaths of unprepared adventurers. This time constraint has significantly limited exploration efforts in Antares' wilderness.

### Signs of Presence

Due to their extradimensional nature, Warp Entities cause abnormal spatial malformations to anchor their existence. Signs of their presence include:

- Twisted and malformed environmental shapes.
- Dark, incorporeal splotches with a strange blue hue.
- Areas dimly lit despite the presence of light sources.
- Gradual appearance of black, claw-like marks on surfaces.
- Dark spots that absorb artificial light.
- Phantom-like forms invisible to optical instruments like spyglasses, telescopes, and cameras.
- Sudden black rain due to their spatial and psychic pollution.

While this list isn't exhaustive, observing two or more of these phenomena in close proximity often indicates the presence of Warp Entities. These signs help experienced adventurers contain and possibly eliminate these entities.

## Traits  

Warp-born entities, exhibit a wide array of traits that defy natural laws. As adventurers and researchers continue to study these entities, their abilities have been categorised into several distinct classifications. These classifications assist in understanding and mitigating the threats posed by these entities.

#### Metastatic  

Entities with Metastatic traits are defined by their rapid spread and ability to propagate their influence. Entities exhibiting these traits are often associated with corruption of their surroundings, creating hazardous zones that inhibit or harm those who enter. The majority of Warp Entities found in Antares' wilderness possess metastatic traits.  

#### Memetic  

Entities with Memetic traits are characterised by their capacity to manipulate cognition and perception. Most interactions with entities exhibiting memetic traits result in severe perceptual distortion, causing individuals to misinterpret their surroundings or allies. Some entities with this trait transfer dangerous knowledge or concepts that destabilise the mental state of those exposed, often leading to long-term psychological effects.  

#### Liminal  

Entities with Liminal traits occupy transitional states, existing between dimensions and other contradictory concepts. These entities are frequently associated with areas of passage, such as planar rifts or doorways, where they serve as guardians or disruptors of thresholds. Their presence often results in environmental anomalies, including warped spatial geometry, altered gravity, or muted sensory perceptions.  

#### Chronal  

Entities with Chronal traits are linked to the manipulation of time. Their presence often leaves echoes of past events, replaying fragments of actions or moments that occurred around them. These entities are capable of accelerating or decelerating time within their vicinity, affecting both themselves and their surroundings. While chronal traits are among the rarest, they are distinguishable through their observable effects.
