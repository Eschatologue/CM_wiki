# Entities

Warp Entities is a collective term for the various extradimensional beings that roam the wilderness of Antares, as well as those influenced by these entities. Commonly referred to as aberrations, demons, or wraiths, the specific names vary across different nations and languages.

## Overview

Beyond the protective walls of Citadel Cities, the wilderness of Antares teems with Warp Entities, posing a constant threat to anyone who ventures out. These entities are byproducts of common Warp Storms, hence their name "Warp Entities." Their appearances vary widely, from humanoids covered in crystalline growths to grotesque forms resembling structures of limbs and eyes, black, foggy, formless bodies, twisted versions of machines, and some even possessing psionic abilities. The most powerful of them can warp space and time.

### Day and Night Behaviour

Warp Entities exhibit different behaviors depending on the time of day. During the day, they are typically in a "neutral" state, attacking only when provoked. However, in the evening and especially at night, these creatures become highly aggressive and coordinated, often resulting in the deaths of unprepared adventurers. This time constraint has significantly limited exploration efforts in Antares' wilderness.

### Signs of Presence

Due to their extradimensional nature, Warp Entities cause abnormal spatial malformations to anchor their existence. Signs of their presence include:

- Twisted and malformed environmental shapes.
- Dark, incorporeal splotches with a strange blue hue.
- Areas dimly lit despite the presence of light sources.
- Gradual appearance of black, claw-like marks on surfaces.
- Dark spots that absorb artificial light.
- Phantom-like forms invisible to optical instruments like spyglasses, telescopes, and cameras.
- Sudden black rain due to their spatial and psychic pollution.

While this list isn't exhaustive, observing two or more of these phenomena in close proximity often indicates the presence of Warp Entities. These signs help experienced adventurers contain and possibly eliminate these entities.

## Classifications

Warp Entities are classified into six categories based on their threat level and the amount of corruption they cause. Named after noble gases, the threat scales exponentially with each category.

Warp Entities prey on anyone they encounter through direct physical confrontation or supernatural tactics such as mind control and hallucinations. They cannot be reasoned with or controlled, hunting indiscriminately without any apparent benefit to themselves.

### Category I: Helium [He]

Helium [He] category entities are the weakest, yet they are abundant and found everywhere from the wilderness to the most corrupted locations. Their threat can escalate significantly due to their sheer numbers. Entities such as Warp Centipedes and Husks belong to this category.

### Category II: Neon [Ne]

Neon [Ne] category entities are stronger and more intelligent than Helium [He] entities. They use basic tactics against their prey rather than relying purely on instinct. Some Neon entities also possess brute strength. Examples include Warptreaders, Blasters, and Lumberjacks.

### Category III: Argon [Ar]

Argon [Ar] category entities are usually mutated Helium [He] or Neon [Ne] entities with increased threat levels, or inherently stronger entities. These are fewer in number but require fully trained soldiers and well-crafted strategies to engage and defeat. For adventurers and raiders, creatures in this category can fetch a good amount of silver, though some sacrifices may be necessary. 

### Category IV: Krypton [Kr]

Krypton [Kr] category entities are exponentially more dangerous than Argon [Ar]. Their presence alone can cause severe Warp Corruption and they are often the source of such corruption. Fortunately, they rarely appear without significant cause and are usually seen in small quantities during Warp Storms. These entities possess powerful psionic and space manipulation abilities and may be amalgamations of several lesser entities fused into one.

While dangerous, Krypton [Kr] entities rarely attack lesser creatures directly, preferring to use lesser entities to do their bidding. They are priority targets during a Warp Storm, as eliminating them significantly reduces the storm's severity.

### Category V: Xenon [Xe]

### Category VI: Radon [Rn]
