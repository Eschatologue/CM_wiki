# Warp Entities

Warp Entities is a collective term for the various extradimensional beings that roam the wilderness of Antares, as well as those influenced by these entities. Commonly referred to as aberrations, demons, or wraiths, the specific names vary across different nations and languages.

## Overview

Beyond the protective walls of Citadel Cities, the wilderness of Antares teems with Warp Entities, posing a constant threat to anyone who ventures out. These entities are byproducts of common Warp Storms, hence their name "Warp Entities." Their appearances vary widely, from humanoids covered in crystalline growths to grotesque forms resembling structures of limbs and eyes, black, foggy, formless bodies, twisted versions of machines, and some even possessing psionic abilities. The most powerful of them can warp space and time.

### Day and Night Behaviour

Warp Entities exhibit different behaviors depending on the time of day. During the day, they are typically in a "neutral" state, attacking only when provoked. However, in the evening and especially at night, these creatures become highly aggressive and coordinated, often resulting in the deaths of unprepared adventurers. This time constraint has significantly limited exploration efforts in Antares' wilderness.

### Signs of Presence

Due to their extradimensional nature, Warp Entities cause abnormal spatial malformations to anchor their existence. Signs of their presence include:

- Twisted and malformed environmental shapes.
- Dark, incorporeal splotches with a strange blue hue.
- Areas dimly lit despite the presence of light sources.
- Gradual appearance of black, claw-like marks on surfaces.
- Dark spots that absorb artificial light.
- Phantom-like forms invisible to optical instruments like spyglasses, telescopes, and cameras.
- Sudden black rain due to their spatial and psychic pollution.

While this list isn't exhaustive, observing two or more of these phenomena in close proximity often indicates the presence of Warp Entities. These signs help experienced adventurers contain and possibly eliminate these entities.

### Confrontation

Warp Entities prey upon anyone they encounter. Common methods include direct physical confrontation and supernatural tactics such as mind control and hallucinations. They cannot be reasoned with or controlled, hunting everything and everyone not connected to the Warp without any apparent benefit to themselves.
