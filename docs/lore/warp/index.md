# The Warp

The Warp is a malevolent force in Antares, producing dangerous phenomena and entities. Both a natural occurrence and an otherworldly influence, it manifests in ways that defy logic and reason. Though its ultimate purpose is unknown, the devastation it causes suggests it aims to drive the inhabitants of Antares to extinction.

## Overview

The Warp is the source of many crises faced by all nations in Antares. It is a violent, unyielding force that cannot be negotiated with, stretching its influence across the wilderness. Some consider it the manifestation of the Nine Hells, though even those infernal realms have been consumed by The Warp at some point in history. It is an all-consuming entity, preying upon all life within the continent.

The Warp can manifest in numerous forms, presenting both potential benefits and overwhelming detriments:

- **Aberrations:** Twisted and horrific creatures born of its chaotic influence, varying in shape and size, each more grotesque and dangerous than the last.
- **Warp Storms:** Violent and unpredictable tempests that bring chaos and destruction wherever they appear.

## Warp Contamination

Cities overtaken by Warp Storms often experience severe mutations among their inhabitants, transforming once-normal citizens into monstrous beings. These mutations are unpredictable and usually catastrophic, warping bodies and minds beyond recognition. The landscape itself can become corrupted, with plants and animals mutating into deadly and unnatural forms.

### Environmental Pollution

The Warp can convert even the most pristine landscapes into a twisted eldritch hell when not contained quickly.

- **Warp Crystals:** Crystalline growths usually start to sprout from the ground, incorporeal at first but eventually becoming solid and acting as anchors for further pollution.
- **Black Rain:** Areas affected by the Warp will experience unending rain made of black viscous liquid, pouring out of nowhere, even indoors and underground. These liquids seemingly phase through inorganic matter while colliding with organic material, making observation and research difficult. The harder the rain, the more polluted the area is.
- **Aberrations:** Aberrations will roam the corrupted area and become more aggressive and territorial.
- **Black Holes:** Randomly placed black holes that absorb light can be observed in polluted areas. Harmless to the touch, they make exploration difficult due to the ineffectiveness of artificial light sources.

### Warp Corruption in Mortals

Not only the environment, hapless mortals can also be influenced and corrupted by the Warp. These unfortunate victims can be noted by the following traits:

- **Hollowed Bodies:** Bodies having black patches and appearing hollow as if lacking organs.
- **Black Blood:** Black liquid, similar in consistency to the black rain, oozing from their bodies.
- **Walking Dead:** Mangled and literally walking corpses that lunge at anything, paired with extreme convulsions and terrifying speed.
- **Featureless Face:** Any facial features replaced with a black hole that absorbs light from electronic or electrical devices, such as flashlights or electric lanterns. Flares, torches, and light from spells or magical means work fine.
- **Fused Bodies:**  Multiple mortals can fuse together, forming grotesque and nightmarish creatures, often larger and more dangerous than their individual components.
- **Crystaline Growth:** Rapid crystalline growth on the body, both externally and internally, killing the affected almost instantly.
