# The Warp

> "We thought these tea addicts were the invaders, but at the very least they can be reasoned with! These fancy rock creatures will just straight up cleave your beards!" -- A Dwarven Mountain Ranger

The Warp is an malevolent force that occurs in Antares, producing a myriad of dangerous phenomena and entities. It is both a natural occurrence and an otherworldly influence, manifesting in ways that defy logic and reason. Though it can be categorized as a faction, its ultimate purpose remains shrouded in mystery. Judging by the devastation it has wrought, it appears intent on driving the inhabitants of Antares to extinction.

The Warp is the source of many crises faced by all nations in Antares. It is a violent, unyielding force that cannot be negotiated with, its influence stretching across the wilderness. Some even call it the manifestation of the Nine Hells, though even those infernal realms have been consumed by The Warp at some point in history. It is an all-consuming entity, a sentient living black hole, preying upon all life within the continent.

The Warp can manifest in numerous forms, presenting both potential benefits and overwhelming detriments. Among its most common manifestations are the abberations that roam the land, twisted and horrific creatures born of its chaotic influence. These abberations vary in shape and size, each one more grotesque and dangerous than the last. The presence of The Warp is also marked by the occurrence of Warp Storms, violent and unpredictable tempests that bring chaos and destruction wherever they appear.

Cities overtaken by Warp Storms often experience severe mutations among their inhabitants, with once-normal citizens transforming into monstrous beings. These mutations are unpredictable and usually catastrophic, warping bodies and minds beyond recognition. The landscape itself can become corrupted, with plants and animals mutating into deadly and unnatural forms. 

Despite the overwhelming danger, there are those who seek to understand The Warp, hoping to harness its power for their own ends. Such endeavors are fraught with peril, as The Warp is an inherently unstable and malevolent force, corrupting all who come into contact with it. Those who delve too deeply into its mysteries often meet grisly ends, their bodies and minds twisted by its influence.
