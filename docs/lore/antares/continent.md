# Antares Continent

The Crown and Misery campaign takes place in the continent of **Antares**. This super-continent is characterized by rugged landscapes, treacherous terrains, and ethereal beauty, presenting both awe-inspiring wonders and unforgiving challenges. The terrain varies dramatically, featuring towering mountain ranges, harsh and searing deserts, an eternal frozen wasteland, and deep, verdant forests, each beckoning wanderers to unravel their hidden mysteries.

## Etymology

The word "Antares" originated from the brightest star in the constellation of Scorpius. It has the Bayer designation α **Scorpii**, which is Latinised to **Alpha Scorpii**. Its traditional name however, derives from the Ancient Greek **Ἀντάρης**, meaning **"rival to Ares".**

## History and Era

The history of Antares is largely obscured by the passage of time and recurrent catastrophic events, which have often prioritised survival over the preservation of records. Despite these challenges, key moments have been recorded, providing insight into the continent's past.

The history of Antares is segmented by events known as "Warp Maelstorms," which mark the transitions between ages. To date, two such maelstorms have been documented, with the possibility of earlier events that have been lost to time.

### The First Maelstorm

The **First Maelstorm** is an ancient event whose specific details are largely unknown. It is known, however, for the collapse of the civilisation known as **Eridu**, the extinction of primordial deities, and the gradual decline of the Aeginae, ancient dragons that once dominated the continent. This event is recognised as the end of the "Old World" and the beginning of a new era.

### The Second Maelstorm

The **Second Maelstorm**, occurring approximately 500 years after the first, is better documented. This event drastically altered the geography of Antares, leading to the destruction of many coastal regions and forcing surviving civilisations to move inland. The maelstorm also resulted in the shattering of the moon, creating a ring around the planet, and increased the frequency of smaller warpstorms. Additionally, this era saw the emergence of the "Spires", beings of immense power that surpassed even that of the gods and Aeginae.

### The Millennium Dawn

The **Millennium Dawn** began approximately 200 years after the Second Maelstorm and is marked by the fall of the Tähdenvalta Empire following the **Great Split**, a major conflict that reshaped the political landscape of Antares. This era has seen the rise of a new power, and it is within this period that current events, including the ongoing D&D campaign, are set.

## Pre-Industrial Revolution

Antares stands at the edge of a transformative age, much like the Industrial Revolution in our world. The remnants of ancient magic and technology are giving way to new ideas and innovations. This period is marked by vast societal changes, as cities begin to expand, machines overtakes the flesh, and the old ways struggle to remain relevant. However, unlike our world, this transition is hindered by the forces of the Warp and the world is still scarred by past apocalypses.

While the Industrial Revolution in our world began in Britain, here it by **London** that leads the charge—already a highly industrialised nation. Despite its efforts to keep its influence in check, other nations are increasingly looking to it as an example of how to drive their own progress, sparking a continent-wide shift toward industrialisation.

## Antares Exploration

Unfortunately, much of Antares remains unexplored due to the relentless catastrophes plaguing the land. The primary threat comes in the form of swarms of aberrations, which become highly aggressive during nighttime, forcing most of Antares' civilizations to wall themselves inside massive, heavily fortified urban structures called Citadel Cities. However, this strategy is becoming increasingly untenable due to the ever-harsher Warp Storms.

## Bleak World and Glimmers of Hope

Surviving in Antares is fraught with peril. The combination of internal strife, such as wars, rebellions, and civil disobedience, and external threats, including Warp Storms and aberrations, makes life exceedingly bleak. Yet, despite the overwhelming challenges, a glimmer of hope remains among the continent's denizens, driving them to endure and seek out the hidden wonders of their world.
