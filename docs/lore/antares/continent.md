# Antares Continent

The Crown and Misery campaign takes place in the continent of **Antares**. This super-continent is characterized by rugged landscapes, treacherous terrains, and ethereal beauty, presenting both awe-inspiring wonders and unforgiving challenges. The terrain varies dramatically, featuring towering mountain ranges, harsh and searing deserts, an eternal frozen wasteland, and deep, verdant forests, each beckoning wanderers to unravel their hidden mysteries.

## Etymology

The word "Antares" originated from the brightest star in the constellation of Scorpius. It has the Bayer designation α **Scorpii**, which is Latinised to **Alpha Scorpii**. Its traditional name however, derives from the Ancient Greek **Ἀντάρης**, meaning **"rival to Ares".**

## History and Era  

The history of Antares is fragmented, eroded by time and reshaped by catastrophe. Recurrent upheavals have forced its people to prioritise survival over record-keeping, leaving only scattered remnants of the past. Despite this, certain key moments endure, marking the continent’s long and violent transformation.  

The passage of time in Antares is measured by cataclysms known as **Warp Maelstorms**—world-shattering events that divide history into distinct ages. Two such Maelstorms have been documented, though traces of earlier upheavals suggest a cycle far older than recorded memory.  

### The First Maelstorm* 

*"The age of dragons and gods ended not with war, but with silence."*  
– Unknown Scholar, post-Maelstorm manuscript  
{ .quote }  

The **First Maelstorm** is an event veiled in obscurity, its precise nature lost to time. What is known is that it marked the collapse of the civilisation of **Eridu**, the extinction of the primordial deities, and the decline of the **Aeginae**, the ancient leviathans who once shaped the land itself. This event heralded the end of the **Old World**, severing the past from the future and beginning a new, uncertain age.  

### The Second Maelstorm  

*"The moon broke, the tides turned against us, and the sky bled fire. We called it the end. We were wrong—it was only the beginning."*  
– Chronicle of the Maelstorm, survivor account  
{ .quote }  

The **Second Maelstorm**, occurring roughly 500 years later, is better understood. This catastrophe reshaped Antares’ very geography—entire coastlines vanished, consumed by the sea, while new landmasses rose in their place. The heavens were likewise scarred, the moon itself fractured, leaving a luminous ring of debris encircling the planet.  

More than a mere calamity, this Maelstorm brought about a profound shift in power. It saw the rise of the **Spires**, beings of unfathomable might who eclipsed even the gods and the Aeginae. Their arrival altered the course of history, redefining the balance of power in a world already on the brink.  

### The Millennium Dawn  

The current age, known as the **Millennium Dawn**, began 300 years after the Second Maelstorm. It was ushered in by the **Great Split**, a war that shattered the **Tähdenvalta Empire**, fracturing the continent's political landscape. The echoes of that conflict still shape the world today, as new powers rise to fill the void. It is within this era that the present struggles—and the unfolding of this campaign—take place.  

## Pre-Industrial Revolution 

*"The old world refuses to die while the new world refuses to be born."*  
– Lothringen Scholar, *On the Age of Progress*  
{ .quote }  

Antares teeters on the precipice of an industrial revolution. The remnants of ancient magic and lost technology linger, but the tide of innovation surges forward, challenging the old ways. Cities expand, machines replace flesh, and the fabric of society is unraveling under the weight of progress.  

At the vanguard of this transformation stands **Albion**—a nation built upon which magic does not exist, built. While it seeks to moderate its influence, the mere existence of its advancements has inspired others to follow suit. The eyes of Antares turn towards Albion, seeking both guidance and power, as the age of industry begins to take root.  

## Antares Exploration 

The true extent of Antares remains unknown. The land is scarred by catastrophe, and its most remote regions are nigh-unreachable due to the relentless hostility of the world itself.  

The greatest threat to exploration comes from the **swarms of aberrations**—eldritch horrors that grow increasingly aggressive by nightfall. To survive, most of Antares’ inhabitants have retreated into **Citadel Cities**—vast, walled bastions built to withstand the horrors beyond. But even these mighty fortresses are not impervious, and with the **Warp Storms** growing ever more severe, even the last strongholds of civilisation are under siege.  

## Bleak World and Glimmers of Hope  

*"The world has ended twice. And yet, we are still here."*  
– Unknown traveller, Antares  
{ .quote }  

Life in Antares is defined by struggle. Civilisations battle not only the horrors beyond their walls, but also the fractures within—wars, rebellions, and unrest that threaten to finish what the Maelstorms began.  

And yet, there is hope. Amidst the darkness, people continue to fight, to build, to seek meaning in a world that refuses to die. The past may be buried, the future uncertain, but in the present, there are those who refuse to be swallowed by despair.  

Their defiance alone ensures that Antares endures.
