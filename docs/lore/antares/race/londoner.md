## Overview

Londoners are a race of sapient mammalian aliens resembling apes (requires citation) that are not native to Antares. They bear a strong resemblance to humans but are physically, significantly weaker, leading them to be classified as “Abhumans.” Despite this physical limitation, Londoners are known for their extraordinary adaptability, creativity, cunning, determination, resilience, and tenacity against overwhelming odds—qualities that often surpass those of other races on Antares.

With no innate connection to the Weave, the concept of magic is foreign to them. However, their advanced technological capabilities more than make for this. Known for their ingenuity, Londoners excel in innovation, construction, and the deployment of complex machines, which they have adapted to navigate and thrive in a world dominated by magic.

## Background

### Origin and The High Wilderness

Londoners, though bearing a strong resemblance to humans, are not native to Antares. As the youngest race on the continent, they have nonetheless made a visible impact in a relatively short time. The first recorded contact between Londoners and the ancient races of Antares dates back to two centuries after the Second Maelstorm. Elven records suggest that a Precursor structure they guarded, known as *The Northern Gate,* unexpectedly activated. From this gate emerged a ragtag group of humanoids resembling humans. Initially, there was confusion, as they were mistaken for Gallians. However, closer contact revealed these “humans” spoke a language unknown to the elves.

After the Londoners settled on the borders of Tähdenvalta, exchanges with the locals revealed that they originated from a separate plane of existence called *The High Wilderness.* According to the Londoners, this plane is a vast, seemingly infinite celestial realm filled with winds, fog, strange flora, and sky-beasts. However, records regarding this realm and the Londoners' origin grew sparse as contact diminished following the onset of the *Great Split*.

### Physically Flawed, Mentally Superior

Though Elves and Gnomes were long considered among the least physically robust races, Londoners proved even less suited by Antares' standards. Historical records note that Londoners struggled to lift a standard-issue elven scimitar and entirely failed to pull even the weakest training bow. Disappointingly, they also lacked any aptitude for even the simplest spellcraft. Yet, what they lack in physical strength, they compensate for with an intelligence and adaptability that astonished both elves and human scholars alike.

### Pessimistic Outlook

Unlike other races, who would have bloated view about themselves, Londoners maintain a deeply pessimistic view of both themselves and the world around them. This outlook is shaped by a long history of conflicts that nearly brought their species to extinction, fostering a general tendency to expect the worst from others. Despite this pessimism, however, it heavily contradicts with their tenacity, while others would break under hopeless situation, they would be more emboldened the more hopeless the situation is.

### Discipline

Londoners are widely noted for their rigorous self-discipline, a trait often seen as extreme by other races. Despite Albion's overabundance of resources, the average Londoner adheres to strict, self-imposed rationing and is inclined to limit personal reliance on their advanced technology and their resources. Many Londoners uphold these practices both within and outside the influence of their government, motivated by a cultural fear to excess and a fear of becoming overly dependent on luxury and convenience.
