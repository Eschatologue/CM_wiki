# Aasimaar

Aasimar are humanoids who bear a resemblance to other species, particularly humans or those touched by the Upper Planes in ages past. Their lifespan averages around 100 years, and they are distinguished by radiant eyes, a halo that floats above their heads, and luminous wings of varying shapes and sizes on their backs. Though these halos and wings appear semi-translucent, they are, in fact, physical structures. Upon an Aasimar’s death, their halo and wings fade away, and certain afflictions or congenital conditions can impact these features.

In Antares, Aasimar are widely recognised for their strong inclination towards “justice,” although their individual interpretations of justice vary significantly. They possess an inherent connection to the Spire of Judgement Falcone, often leading others to assume they are bound to its will. In truth, Aasimar retain autonomy in interpreting the Spire’s intent, resulting in a range of practices that, while occasionally unorthodox, are generally well-meaning.

The majority of Aasimar are born in Soterrano, where they form a significant portion of the population and with a natural proficiency for divine magic, they frequently occupy roles in law enforcement within the subterranean nation. However, due to Soterrano’s emphasis on maintaining a diverse government, Aasimar are often restricted from attaining high-ranking political positions, ensuring that no single race dominates the nation’s parliamentary leadership.

## legacy of vorthalas
