# Aasimar

Aasimar are humanoid beings who resemble other species, particularly humans or those once touched by the Upper Planes in ancient eras. With lifespan typically spans around 100 years, they are easily identified by their distinct features: radiant eyes, a hovering halo, and luminous wings that vary in shape and size. Although these halos and wings appear semi-translucent, they are tangible structures that fade upon an Aasimar’s death. Certain afflictions or congenital conditions may also affect the appearance or function of these features.

In Antares, Aasimar are known for ideals towards concepts of “justice,” although each individual’s interpretation can differ. Their unique connection to the Spire of Judgement, Falcone, often leads to the assumption that Aasimar are subservient to its influence. However, they retain autonomy in how they interpret the Spire’s will, resulting in a variety of practices that, while sometimes unconventional, generally align with a broad sense of justice.

Most, if not all of Aasimar are born in Soterrano, where they comprise the majority population. With their natural aptitude for divine magic, they often serve in roles tied to law enforcement and justice department within the subterranean nation. Despite this, Soterrano’s governmental structure restricts Aasimar from holding high-ranking political offices, ensuring no single race holds disproportionate sway over the nation’s.

## Legacy of Vorthalas

Centuries before the Second Rapture, Aasimar were ordinary mortals from various species who were blessed an aeginae called Vorthalas, *The Engraver*. Mortals who demonstrated extraordinary commitment to justice, or to what Vorthalas defined as justice, were blessed with divine power, transforming them an Aasimar. Many became paladins, while others unlocked latent sorcerous abilities.

As the Aasimar spread across Antares, so did the teachings of Vorthalas. Though teachings spreads, the Aeginae themselves were dwindling. Some succumbs to age, conflicts, or other causes. Vorthalas itself was overtaken by an aasimar named Falcone, who ultimately ascended to become the Spire of Judgement. This ascension marked the end of the Aasimar’s link to the Vorthalas, yet it also introduced new powers and restrictions. Aasimar gained the ability to manifest angelic wings and, under certain conditions, to fly, but became bound to the Spire’s influence. When travelling far from Soterrano, Aasimar experience effects such as; memory loss, emotional detachment, and sociopathic tendencies. The full extent of these effects remains unclear.

## Vorthalas' Betrayal and Falcone’s Ascension

The full extent of the decline of the Aeginae is still up for a debate, but the fall of Vorthalas is particularly a well documented oone. Vorthalas’s teachings on justice were summarised in a guiding principle: *“How much wrong can be righted, before it became wrong?”*. This koan is intended as a cautionary message, urging Aasimar to exercise restraint, warning them against letting their pursuit of justice spiral into vengeance.

Yet as Vorthalas neared its end, it became a victim of the very zeal it had once counselled against. In its pursuit of an absolute form of “justice,” the Engraver unleashed indiscriminate destruction across Antares. With their once-revered benefactor turned destructive force, the Aasimar were forced to slay what gives them purpose. The quest to slay the Engraver was brutal, though during this extermination, one Aasimar conviction managed to surpass that of an Aeginae. In doing so, they absorbed its power and ascended to become Falcone, the Spire of Judgement.
