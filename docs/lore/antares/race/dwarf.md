## Overview

Dwarves, also known as *Durinn*, are a humanoid race native to the central region of Antares, particularly the Myrkheim mountains. The majority of Dwarves reside in the nation of Myrkheim, characterised by its rugged terrain and subterranean cities. Dwarves are easily recognised by their short and stature, pointed ears, and often with beards. They are known for their cultural affinity for heavy drinking and their exceptional skills as miners, geologists, and underground surveyors. 

While most Dwarves are born in Myrkheim, many now live outside their homeland, with the largest community found in the Caerdyf Commissariat, a territory once part of Myrkheim but now under London's influence. Dwarves are also renowned for their expertise in niche, advanced technologies, combining their craftsmanship with the influence of London. They often construct vast, intricate cities within mountains, with structures that can rival the cities of the surface world.

Dwarves tend to have a pragmatic outlook on life, valuing their clan relationships over national identity. Their strong sense of community and craftsmanship remains central to their culture.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

In ancient times, Dwarves were among the most dominant races in Antares, standing alongside Elves and Humans as key powers of the world. However, in the present day, following the fall of the Tahdenvalta Empire at the hands of Albion and the revolution in Gallia, the Dwarves appear to be the last remaining dominant force. In reality, though, their influence and stability are largely supported by their alliance with Albion, with the Dwarves now standing on the figurative shoulders of this leviathan power.

## Long Memory, Long Grudges

Dwarves typically live for around 250 years, with the oldest members having witnessed a very different world. They remember the turbulent centuries of the Age of Strife, the expulsion of the Elves, and the costly mistakes made by their leaders during the war against Albion. This extended lifespan grants them a perspective that shorter-lived races may lack. In the ever-changing world, Dwarves must be as enduring as the mountains, yet as adaptable as the rivers that flow through their lands. While tradition is highly valued, it must be tempered with the wisdom of the ages

!!! quote "Slow to Trust"

    Dwarves, shaped by a history of conflict and betrayal, are known for keeping others at arm's length. However, they are also regarded as a fair and pragmatic people, valuing loyalty and honesty in those who manage to break through their renowned stubbornness. According to legend, the surest (and quickest) path to a Dwarf's trust is by besting them in a drinking game—an achievement that, for millennia, no outsider has accomplished.

    **Elves**  *"Some say it's hard to tell a wood elf from a high elf, but for us, it's easy. One could be an ally, while the other would smile as they twist a knife in your back and whisper you empty words. Besides, have you seen the Generator those wood elves built in the north? Marvellous piece of work!”*

    **Humans**  "Humans are ambitious folk, always pushing boundaries, and they get things done quickly—sometimes too quickly. They're unpredictable, a blessing and a curse, yet in their drive for progress, there's a spark we respect. Share a forge or a drink with one, and you'll find they're not so different from us... though maybe a touch more reckless."

    **Londoners**  *"Those tea addicts have the strength of a twig! But, ah, their inventions! Centuries ahead of anything we've got. And they're a frightening lot—what we'd call horrors is mere child's play to them. Makes you wonder what they've seen to turn them like that…"*
