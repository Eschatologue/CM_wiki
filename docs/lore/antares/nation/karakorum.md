# Karakorum  

The **Karakorum Alliance**, often referred to simply as **Karakorum**, is a nomadic coalition of colossal arks traversing the coastlines of Antares. Each of the three remaining arks is renowned for its unique role and identity: one is celebrated for the bravery of its warriors, acting as a stronghold and a source of legendary mercenaries; another is distinguished by its intricate trade network, serving as a hub of commerce and diplomacy for nations across Antares; and the final ark, the seat of power for the alliance, is famed for its grand architecture, which inspires scholars and artisans alike.  

Unlike traditional nations, Karakorum operates as an alliance, bound by a divine mandate to seek a sanctuary free from the Warp’s influence—a quest that has persisted for centuries without success. Once comprising five colossal arks, the alliance now survives with three, sustaining their endless voyage through trade with other nations, offering unique goods and expertise in exchange for vital resources only found in land.

## History

Karakorum originated as a group of nations in Antares' eastern region, including the now-desolate archipelagos. For centuries, these nations were embroiled in constant warfare. However, the **Second Rapture** brought widespread destruction, with unrelenting tsunamis and earthquakes devastating the entire region. This cataclysm forced the warring factions to abandon their conflicts and focus on survival.

The turning point came with the unearthing of an ancient ruin linked to **Eridu**, revealing lost precursor technologies. A single nation, the **Khaganate**, took the lead in repurposing these discoveries, constructing immense vessels to escape the tsunamis and fend off the **Warp-born Aberrations** that followed in the wake of the Rapture. Seeing the Khaganate’s success, other nations united under its banner, pooling resources and manpower to create additional arks.

Tragically, the first Khan, who spearheaded these efforts, was left behind on land and fell to the Aberrations as the arks set sail. His death became a pivotal moment for the alliance, binding its members to a shared vow: to fulfil their divine mandate to find a haven free from the Warp’s corruption and lay their uniter to rest in peace.
