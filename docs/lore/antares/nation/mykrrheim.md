# Mykrrheim

The **Federal Republic of Mykrrheim**, commonly known as **Mykrrheim**, is a bustling nation centered amidst the towering peaks and deep ravines of the Antares mountains. Primarily inhabited by dwarves, Mykrrheim thrives as a center of mining and craftsmanship. Its architecture seamlessly merges with the rugged terrain, with cliffs transformed into formidable fortresses and bridges connecting different parts of the city.

Once infamous for its inhabitants' quirky language, specialized products, and constant civil wars, Mykrrheim has rapidly emerged as a thriving economic powerhouse in Antares. The nation has established itself as a relentless supplier of raw materials, catering to the needs of various countries across the continent. Drawing upon their inherent expertise in minerals and mining, the dwarves of Mykrrheim have perfected the art of extracting and refining resources. Moreover, the technological advancements brought forth through their close partnerships with London have further bolstered their capabilities.

## Background

### Origins and Early Conflicts

Mykrrheim was once a land inhabited by fragmented dwarven clans, plagued by constant conflicts and power struggles. Each clan had its own 'mountain' territory, with wars fought underground or through swift maneuvers across jagged peaks and ravine edges. Over time, this combat style was refined, forming the unique capabilities of the dwarves.

During this period, the Midgard mountain ranges (now renamed to Mykrrheim mountains) were locked in a state of constant civil wars and social upheavals. This era was characterized by the overthrow of superior powers by subordinate ones, with traditional master-servant relationships breaking down. Vassals eliminated lords, internal clan conflicts over leadership were rampant, and frequent rebellions and puppet leaderships by branch families against the lord's family were common. Local rebellions against said lords rose to power, continuing the cycle for centuries.

### The First Maelstrom

Everything changed during the First Maelstrom, a cataclysmic event that devastated the dwarven clans, wiping out many in minutes. Faced with immense loss, the surviving clans were compelled to set aside their differences, not out of altruism, but because there was no one left to fight against. With staggering losses, most leadership either perished or found themselves ruling over no subjects.

### Seeking Elven Guidance

Afterward, the frequency of minor warp storms steadily increased over a few decades. Facing an unmanageable threat, the dwarves eventually broke down and rekindled an ancient, highly unpopular oath to seek guidance from their long-time rivals, the elves. This alliance marked gradual improvements in dwarven society but came at a steep cultural cost.

This period, known as the "Age of Restoration," saw the dwarves benefit from the elves' superior arcane aptitude and ancient knowledge. Slowly, condemned sectors of the Mykrrheim mountain ranges were reclaimed from Warp Entities, cities were built, and populations grew. However, as the elves infiltrated dwarven leadership, they began replacing dwarven culture with their own. The more cities built, the more they resembled elven architecture. The more books and records restored, the more they were rewritten to favour the elves.

### The Forest Culling

Eventually, the cultural erosion became evident. Dwarven leadership attempted to negotiate with the elves, but discussions were difficult, and peaceful solutions seemed impossible. Open rebellion was considered the only solution. This idea was proposed by the three major clans: The Vedrfolnir, responsible for politics and intelligence; The Hraesvelgr, providing manpower; and The Rhinedottir, funding the effort.

For the first time in centuries, the dwarven lords worked together to retake Mykrrheim from the elves. Using the elves' own lessons in dirty politics, leveraging their manpower and funding, these three houses seized key positions and rapidly scaled up to open rebellion. Known as "The Forest Culling," this period of history was marked by the mass expulsion and extermination of elves within Mykrrheim. The brutality of this event is still debated, but it is argued that without it, the dwarves might have been too late to reclaim control.
