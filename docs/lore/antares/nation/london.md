# Albion

The **Dominion of Albion**, officially referred to as **Albion** and commonly known as **London**, is a nation located in the northwestern part of Antares, characterised by its sprawling metropolis of steel and glass, and bleeding-edge technology, built over the former elven forests. Albion is widely regarded as a bastion of industrial might and military prowess, standing among the most influential nations in Antares.

## History

### Origins and Emergence

The precise origins of Albion remain a topic of academic debate. The sudden emergence of a powerful nation, born from a group of refugees, is often described as a historical anomaly. Historical records, particularly those kept by the elves, suggest that the first documented encounters with the Londoners occurred several decades before the fall of the Great Elven Empire. These records point to their arrival through an enigmatic structure known as the **Northern Gate**.

One day, the statue guarding the gate illuminated, and its doors unexpectedly opened. The elves, anticipating a hostile force, instead found a group of humans in tattered clothing, many of them injured. These refugees introduced themselves as "British" and, despite their modest appearance, demonstrated a surprising degree of intelligence and technical expertise. In the following years, the British population grew rapidly, with their camps developing into towns, and eventually, vast cities that rivalled the grandeur of ancient dwarven settlements.

### Rising Tensions with the Elves

As Albion's presence expanded, relations with the elves deteriorated. Initially, the elves had offered sanctuary to the refugees, but their rapid growth soon raised concerns. During this period, elven politics took a sharp turn towards nationalism and fanaticism. As the Londoners lacked the arcane abilities that the elves wielded, the latter began to view their technological advancements with suspicion. 

Under the pretext of reclaiming ancestral lands, elven forces began encroaching on Albion's territory. The elves demanded access to London's technological secrets, and when these demands were refused, they resorted to increasingly aggressive tactics, including the abduction and enslavement of London citizens.

The expansion of Albion's urban landscape also contributed to the rising tensions. Forests that had stood for centuries were cleared to accommodate new settlements, an act initially dismissed by the elves. However, as deforestation continued, it sparked outrage among elven communities who viewed it as an assault on their sacred lands. The mounting hostilities eventually led to open warfare between the two factions.

### The Great Split

The ensuing conflict, later known as **The Great Split**, is widely regarded as one of the bloodiest and most consequential wars in Antares' history. The war pitted the fey magic and nature-based forces of the elves against Albion's industrial might. It marked the first time that a non-magical force successfully challenged the dominance of powers in the region.

The war was characterised by brutal, large-scale battles that devastated much of the land. In a decisive and final act, Albion's forces succeeded in breaching one of the elves' most sacred sites and felling **Yggdrasil**, the tree of life. This not only crippled the elves' morale but also marked the symbolic end of their supremacy, ushering in a new era dominated by technological might.

## Society

Albion has a unique and often perplexing society compared to other nations. Where many countries adopt an optimistic or inflated view of their own grandeur, Albion's worldview is starkly different. The country is steeped in a deep-rooted pessimism, born from a history of perpetual warfare.

Historians from Albion note that the nation has experienced no sustained period of peace for over two centuries. This unbroken cycle of conflict has shaped a society that values discipline, duty, and the collective over individual desires. The state's authority is maintained through a strict social order, with citizen participation in governance being mandatory. From a young age, children are taught to prioritise their responsibilities to the nation, ensuring that the survival of Albion takes precedence over personal aspirations.

### Government Structure

Albion operates as a borderline stratocracy, where military and civil governance are intertwined. Citizens are not only encouraged but required to serve the government for a period, often through military service or sometimes civil roles. This fusion of military and civilian life reinforces Albion's robust sense of discipline and unity, where governance is seen as a collective duty shared by all.

Despite its rigid structure, the Dominion of Albion is notably inclusive of all species, creeds, and backgrounds. However, this inclusiveness stems more from practical necessity than from a sense of altruism. The need for manpower, resources, and expertise from a variety of sources has driven Albion to adopt a more open policy.
