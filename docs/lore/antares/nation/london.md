# Dominion of Albion

The **Dominion of Albion**, officially called **Albion** and commonly known as **London**, is a country located in the northwest of Antares. It is the new beating heart of the renewed British Empire, nestled within a sprawling metropolis of steel edifices and gleaming glass thats what once a verdant forest claimed by the elves. London stands as a beacon of prosperity and military might, earning its place as one of Antares' most influential and formidable nations.

## Background

### Origins and Emergence

The origins of present-day London remain a subject of scholarly debate. The transformation of a nation predominantly composed of refugees into one of the strongest powers in Antares is nothing short of a miracle. Recorded encounters with these "tea addicts" date back several decades before the fall of the Great Elven Empire, coinciding with the location where New London now stands. Elven records indicate their arrival through a mysterious structure known as "[The Northern Gate](../../entry/the-gate.md)," an ancient ruin said to have existed for as long as the oldest high-elf can remember.

One day, the statue guarding the gate illuminated, and its gates opened. Expecting invaders from the skies, the elves were surprised to encounter a large group of humans clad in rags, wounded, and some even missing limbs. These individuals identified themselves collectively as "British," emphasizing their nationality over their raceâ€”a concept that puzzled many. Despite their humble appearance, these Londoners displayed remarkable intelligence and skills across various disciplines, bringing invaluable knowledge to this new world. In a remarkably short span of time, the refugee population exploded, leading to the rapid expansion of their settlements. Camps evolved into towns, then cities, eventually rivaling the grandeur of some of the largest dwarven settlements.

### Rising Tensions with the Elves

As London influence grew, the elves, who had initially provided sanctuary, began to perceive them as a significant threat. During this period, elven politics underwent a significant shift toward fanaticism and extreme nationalism. The elves, who possessed superior arcane abilities that the Londoners lacked, began infiltrating Albion territories under the pretext of reclaiming ancestral lands. Hostilities escalated as the elves made increasingly aggressive moves against the Albion government, culminating in abductions and the enslavement of its citizens when the government refused to share technological advancements with the elves.

The expansion of Albion came at a cost, as more forested areas were cleared to accommodate urban growth. Initially disregarded by the elves, the extensive deforestation eventually reached a tipping point, prompting the elves to take action against what they perceived as the desecration of their land. Tensions simmered until they erupted into open conflict, leading to a war between the two factions.

### The Great Split

The conflict, known as "The Great Split," was among the deadliest and bloodiest in Antares history, marked by unfettered brutality and open warfare between the forces of nature and elven arcane superiority against Londons war machines and industrial might. It represented a pivotal moment in Antares, where those lacking arcane prowess asserted dominance for the first time. Despite London gaining the upper hand, the war remained brutal.

In a desperate final move, the London's Army breached one of the most sacred and protected places of the elves, felling Yggdrassil, the tree of life. This act was not only a strategic blow to the elves but also a symbolic triumph for London, signaling their defiance against elven supremacy and the dawn of a new era in Antares history.

## Modern Time

### Society

The culture and society of London can often be seen as eclectic to other nations and visitors. While most nations have adapted an inflated and optimistic view of their own greatness, London is the stark opposite, organised around a pessimistic outlook on the world and its people. 

London is a byproduct of perpetual warfare that constantly threatens its existence. Some historians from London have said that the nation has not experienced any period of peace for the past two centuries, not even including the time after London arrived in Antares.

As a consequence, instead of trusting in everyone's better nature, it relies more on the sword of the state to keep everyone in line. Citizen participation in the functioning of the state is mandatory, and children are even raised from a young age to view their responsibilities to the social whole as more important than their individual desires.

### Technological Advancements

London has become renowned for its groundbreaking technological advancements. Unlike other nations in Antares that rely on traditional arcane technology, London has focused on developing firearms, artillery, dreadnoughts, airships, and even power armours. These innovations have made its military one of the most formidable forces on the continent. 

### Current Political Climate

Today, London continues to influence Antares significantly. The parliament's priorities have shifted to improving the livelihoods of its citizens while also addressing the elven rebellion within its borders. Despite ongoing conflicts, London remains a beacon of prosperity and military might in Antares.
