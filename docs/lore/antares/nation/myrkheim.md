# Myrkheim

The **Federal Republic of Myrkheim**, commonly known as **Myrkheim**, is a dwarf-dominated nation located in the mountainous regions of Antares. Known for its expertise in mining and craftsmanship, the dwarves have transformed their rugged terrain into formidable fortresses and industrial cities. Once fractured by internal conflicts, Myrkheim is now a major supplier of raw materials to nations across Antares, bolstered by technological partnerships with London.

## History

### Origins and Early Conflicts

Myrkheim’s early history was marked by constant clan warfare, as dwarves vied for control over mountain territories. These wars forged their combat prowess and resulted in centuries of social upheaval, with power struggles between vassals and lords being a common occurrence.

### The Second Maelstrom

The **Second Maelstrom** decimated many dwarven clans, forcing the survivors to unite. This shift wasn’t born from altruism but necessity, as the devastation left few to continue the endless wars. With leadership and populations shattered, the remaining dwarves banded together to survive.

### Seeking Elven Guidance

Facing increasing threats from minor warp storms, the dwarves reluctantly turned to their ancient rivals, the elves, for aid. This period, known as the **Age of Restoration**, saw the elves help rebuild Myrkheim, but at a cultural cost. As dwarven cities were reclaimed and rebuilt, they began to reflect elven influence, leading to a slow erosion of dwarven traditions.

### The Forest Culling

The infiltration of elven culture sparked discontent among the dwarven clans. Led by the Vedrfolnir, Hraesvelgr, and Rhinedottir clans, the dwarves launched the **Forest Culling**, a violent expulsion of elves from Myrkheim. This event was marked by both rebellion and brutal reprisals, ending elven dominance within their society.

## Modern Era

### The Dwarvish-London War

The **Dwarvish-London War**, also called **The Great War**, was a brief but devastating conflict between Myrkheim and London. Myrkheim, once the strongest nation in Antares, sought to assert dominance over the newly established London, attempting to turn it into a vassal state. Misjudging London’s strength, the dwarves were swiftly defeated by the superior technology of London’s war machine.

Myrkheim suffered heavy losses, with several citadels falling into London’s hands. Though they retained sovereignty, London's presence in Myrkheim became substantial, and the influx of technology that followed sparked both advancements and fears of renewed cultural erosion.
