# Lothringen  

## Overview  

> *"We don’t rely on the old ways or wait for blessings from gods—we build with our hands, our minds, and our will. We shape our own future."*{ .emq }  
— Wilhelm von Lothringen, Kaiser of Lothringen
{ .quote }

The **Empire of Lothringen**, often simply called **Lothringen**, is a nation marked by its distinct culture, independent spirit, and drive for innovation. Unlike many other nations in Antares, Lothringen thrives on a mix of craftsmanship, industry, and commerce. With a rich history of arts and trade, its people have long been known for their resilience and ingenuity. The empire is an amalgamation of old-world tradition and forward-thinking progress, where innovation isn't just encouraged—it's expected.

Once part of Gallia, the province of Lorraine, Lothringen was always a unique entity with its own customs, language, and lifestyle. The relationship with Gallia was one of simmering tension, and with the outbreak of the Gallian Revolution, Lothringen saw its opportunity to break free and declare its independence. Now, a sovereign nation under the rule of its **Kaiser**, Lothringen is a proud and distinct entity on the map of Antares.

## History  

### Gallia & Lothringen  

> *"Gallia did not forge an empire. It gathered the spoils of war and called it unity."*{ .emq }  
— Marquis Henri de Dorian, Gallian noble

The history of Lothringen has always been intertwined with Gallia, yet starkly different. Gallia, as an empire, expanded through conquest, absorbing various cultures and peoples. But the province of Lorraine, unlike other conquered regions, developed its own identity—an identity that was never fully recognised by the Gallian elite. The people of Lorraine spoke their own dialect, their architecture was distinct, and their customs set them apart. They lived not by the pomp of Gallian nobility but by the practical skills of artisans, merchants, and craftsmen. Where Gallia favoured fine wines and courtly affairs, Lorraine thrived on hearty bread, trade, and the everyday hustle of its people.

Despite this, Lorraine’s prosperity was tied to Gallia’s demands. The kingdom relied heavily on the resources, goods, and skilled labour that Lorraine produced. Yet the cultural rift remained. The people of Lorraine never quite fit in, often feeling like second-class citizens in their own land. 

> *"We gave them what they asked for, only for them to bite the hand that fed them."*{ .emq }  
— Chancellor Jean-Paul Besson, Gallian statesman

### The Road to Independence  

> *"To call it a 'revolution' is to undermine the treachery that took place. It was nothing more than opportunism. Dishonorable, disgusting, appalling"*{ .emq }  
— Countess Marguerite de Vachon, Gallian noblewoman  
{ .quote }

When the Gallian Revolution sparked civil unrest across the empire, it provided the perfect opportunity for Lothringen to assert its independence. The rebellion, though swift, was meticulously planned. **Lord Wilhelm**, then a nobleman in Lorraine, recognised that the weakening power of Gallia would never come again. With a carefully executed campaign, the people of Lothringen swiftly expelled Gallian forces from the region.

Once the Gallian presence was gone, the region was in turmoil, but the people had already rallied behind the idea of a new nation. With little opposition from the outside, Wilhelm declared himself Kaiser. He assumed leadership, not through inheritance, but by the will of the people, the momentum of the rebellion, and the demand for a new direction. The old Gallian nobility still had some influence in Lothringen, but their support was fragmented, and their power was fading. The new nation was ready to take shape.

### A New Empire  

> *"We built this empire with our own hands. From the ground up, we forged Lothringen."*{ .emq }  
— Wilhelm von Lothringen, Kaiser of Lothringen

Lothringen’s independence was swift, but its journey to becoming a unified empire wasn’t easy. The Kaiser, Wilhelm, faced challenges from within—old nobility clashed with the emerging industrial and merchant classes, and skirmishes broke out over the direction the new empire should take. But the strength of the Lothringen people—tough, industrious, and fiercely independent—saw the nation through.

By the time Wilhelm solidified his position, Lothringen had established itself as an economic powerhouse. The nation became a hub for trade, industry, and craftsmanship. Its cities grew rapidly, with a focus on building infrastructure that could support the increasing demands of its growing population. Lothringen’s strategic location allowed it to become a key player in the economic and political landscape of Antares. While the old Gallian Empire struggled to maintain control, Lothringen’s independence was fully cemented.
