# Lothringen

**Lothringen**, officially known as the **Empire of Lothringen**, is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, encompassing vibrant arts, literature, and a unique magical discipline known as **Artifice**, which blends magic and technology. Its openness to innovation and diverse ideas sets it apart from most nations in Antares, and its celebrated **Minstrel** are esteemed across the continent.

Formerly a Gallian territory known as *Lorraine*, Lothringen declared independence during the Gallian Revolution. The regionâ€™s distinct culture and traditions had long differentiated it from the Gallian core, and the revolution provided the opportunity to break away. Now a sovereign nation under the rule of its **Kaiser**, Lothringen stands as an independent political entity in Antares.
