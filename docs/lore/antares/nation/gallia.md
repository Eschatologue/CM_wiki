## Overview

The **Empire of Gallia**, also referred to as the **Gallian Empire**, is an empire located in the south-east of the Antares continent. Once the dominant power in the region, with its capital **Lyon** serving as the heart of Antares, the empire's supremacy was severely weakened by the Second Rapture and aa violent revolution soon after.

Despite these challenges, Gallia remains a significant centre of arcane knowledge, renowned for its magical traditions. The empire continues to influence arcane warfare and hosts Antares' most prestigious military academy, where noble-born mages and sorcerers are trained in both magic and strategy. Though no longer commanding the largest military, Gallia focuses on preserving its remaining territories and protecting its magical heritage.

## History

Gallia once exerted control over vast regions of Antares, celebrated for its powerful mages and its cultural influence. The empire's practices, collectively known as **Le système Gallien**, were highly respected across the continent, and the Gallian language has since evolved into the “common tongue” spoken throughout Antares.

Despite its outward success, Gallia was plagued by profound societal inequality. The aristocracy enjoyed lives of privilege, while the common people were subjected to heavy taxation and harsh living conditions. This imbalance eventually led to a revolution that nearly tore the empire apart. Although the uprising was eventually quelled, it left deep and lasting scars on Gallian society.

As warp storms increased in frequency and London emerged as a rival power, Gallia adopted a more pragmatic stance. It reduced the size of its military, abandoned unfortified territories, and focused its efforts on defending its core regions.

### Gallian Revolution

The **Gallian Revolution** erupted as widespread frustration among the common populace reached a breaking point. Burdened by oppressive taxes and scarcity of resources, and angered by the extravagance of the nobility, a movement led by disillusioned scholars, merchants, and lower-tier mages sought to dismantle the system of noble dominance and challenge the rule of the **sorcerer-emperor**.

For a time, the revolutionaries gained ground, seizing key cities and rallying widespread support. However, the nobility responded with a brutal counteroffensive, employing powerful spellcasters and enlisting mercenaries to crush the uprising. After years of conflict, the revolution was ultimately suppressed.

In the aftermath, while the nobility maintained its hold on power, they were forced to acknowledge the fractures within their system. Minor reforms were introduced, granting limited concessions to the commoners, including reduced taxes and marginal improvements to their rights.

#### Dwindling Resources

As the empire's power was increasingly stretched thin, **Empress Corsica II** initiated reforms aimed at creating a more efficient system of governance. These changes shifted power away from the traditional nobility and granted greater authority to merchants and individuals from non-noble backgrounds.

However, these reforms did little to alleviate the long-standing tension between the noble class and the commoners. The Sub-Revolution, while modernising Gallia's governmental structure, was primarily a response to the empire's declining resources and was driven by the need to protect Gallia's remaining territories from external threats.

The reforms of Empress Corsica II are believed to have been motivated by a failed assassination attempt against her, orchestrated by discontented nobles. Historical accounts suggest that the empress was initially unaware of the revolution's scale until revolutionaries breached the imperial palace. In a desperate act of self-defence, Corsica II killed several attackers with her sorcery. After discovering the plot against her, she enacted sweeping reforms to secure her position and consolidate her power.

### Imperial Council Overhaul

In the aftermath of the Sub-Revolution, **Empress Corsica II** undertook a radical reform of the imperial council, introducing a merit-based selection process for council members. Previously, these positions had been the exclusive privilege of the nobility, but under the empress's new system, individuals from any background could theoretically qualify for a seat on the council.

This move was met with strong resistance from the aristocracy, who viewed it as an affront to their centuries-old rights. Despite the introduction of meritocratic principles, the majority of successful candidates remained from noble backgrounds, as they were more likely to have access to the education and resources required to compete. Although this reform was perceived by many as another attempt by Empress Corsica II to cement her power, it did allow for a limited degree of social mobility, enabling talented commoners to rise within the empire's ranks.

*“She has taken leave of her senses. To allow commoners—peasants—to sit among the Empire's rulers is the height of madness.”* — Anonymous Gallian noble (found dead the following day).

### Lothringen Rebellion

For centuries, the region of **Lothringen** (formerly known as Lorraine) was a subject territory of the Gallian Empire. However, during the period of the revolution, the Lothringian people seized the opportunity to declare independence. 

With Gallia preoccupied by widespread unrest and mass protests in its core territories, Lothringen faced little resistance. Minor skirmishes occurred along the borders, but Gallia lacked the resources and focus to mount a coordinated response. As a result, Lothringen successfully detached itself from the empire's rule and established itself as an independent political entity, led by its newly crowned **Kaiser**. 

In the modern era, relations between Gallia and Lothringen remain shaky at best. By the time Gallia somewhat recovered its stability, Lothringen had already developed into a well-established and functioning nation. With a sophisticated military and a strategic political presence in Antares, retaking the territory has become increasingly difficult, especially as Gallia no longer had its former strength. 

## Government Structure

Gallia is an empire led by an **emperor** or **empress**, who holds significant power but does not rule alone. A council made up of nobles and other high-ranking officials helps manage the empire. Though the emperor or empress makes the final decisions, the council handles day-to-day governance and advises on important matters.

This system allows for more efficient rule, especially after the reforms introduced by **Empress Corsica II**, which opened the council to a broader group of individuals.

## Society

Gallia is divided between the **nobility** and the **commoners**. The nobility enjoy great privileges, including access to education and others, while the commoners work hard and pay heavy taxes. Though recent reforms have allowed some commoners to rise in status, the divide between the two groups remains wide. Most mages and military leaders still come from noble families, as they have the resources to receive the best training. However, there is now a small chance for talented commoners to improve their lives, thanks to the merit-based reforms.
