# Valinor [draft]

The **State of Valinor**, commonly known as **Valinor**, is a city-state in the northernmost region of the Antares frozen wasteland. It stands as a luminous and fiery sanctuary amidst the vast expanse of snow. This nation predominantly comprises elves, many of whom were displaced refugees from The Great Forest and Mykrrheim, as well as political exiles seeking sanctuary.

The elves of Valinor have overcome the harsh challenges of their environment through a remarkable feat of engineering. Known as the "Irminsul," this towering engine is a crucial lifeline for the nation, providing much-needed heat and energy to combat the relentless onslaught of the perpetual winter that blankets the forsaken wasteland.

In addition to the renowned Irminsul, Valinor is celebrated for its magnificent halls of study and an extensive repository of books and literature. Once shrouded in secrecy, this knowledge has been opened to the world, beckoning eager minds seeking knowledge and enlightenment despite the arduous journey required to reach Valinor. Young students from various races and nations across Antares flock to this academic haven to satisfy their intellectual pursuits.

## Background

### Political Turmoil and Exile

As the tides of elven politics abruptly shifted, the once-cherished nations of the elves descended into oppressive fervor and ideological extremism. This transformation struck a dissonant chord within the elven community. While they had always embraced their rich heritage and vibrant culture, this newfound fanaticism surpassed even their own lofty standards.

Under the tightening grip of the regime, dissent became an unforgivable offense. Opposition or even the mildest criticism of the government was swiftly crushed. Dissenting voices were branded as traitors, persecuted, and subjected to detention and exile. The pervasive ideology infiltrated every aspect of society, permeating the education system, the arts, and the private lives of the elven population. Propaganda machines worked tirelessly to shape public opinion and instill unwavering loyalty to the ruling regime. The essence of elven identity was distorted to serve the interests of those in power.

### War and Resistance

Amid the escalating war between the elves and the Londoners, the situation took a darker turn. The conflict, despised by many, stifled dissent, forcing individuals into silence. Those brave enough to voice opposition were swiftly conscripted and sent to the brutal frontlines, never to be seen again.

However, amidst the turmoil, a flicker of hope emerged. A covert elven resistance group made a remarkable discovery—an abandoned Land Dreadnought left behind by retreating London forces. Seizing this opportunity, they quickly took control of the colossal steel behemoth, capturing some Londoners to unravel its intricate workings. Despite the significant language barrier, the resourceful elves managed to decipher the foreign controls.

### The Great Exodus

As the war raged on, the determined resistance group sought to gather their fellow elves and unite them around this newfound weapon of war. Day by day, they toiled tirelessly to assemble and invite as many surviving elves as possible to join them aboard their formidable mechanical steed.

With their homeland lost and no hope for a future there, these refugees embarked on a treacherous journey to escape their oppressive past. Carrying vital supplies and a resolute group of individuals, they set their sights on a distant horizon, yearning for a fresh start in uncharted territories. The colossal Land Dreadnought, their refuge and means of transportation, became a symbol of hope as they ventured into the unknown.

Weeks turned into months as they pressed onward, their spirits unwavering despite their challenges. Inside the dreadnought, tensions ran high, with the constant threat of betrayal lurking among their ranks. Trust was tested as they played a perilous game of identifying traitors. Survival depended on their ability to stay united and discern friend from foe.

Finally, after enduring countless hardships and battling the unforgiving elements, they arrived in the frigid expanse of the frozen wastes. The land before them, harsh and desolate, would become their new home. As they gazed upon the colossal steel behemoth that had carried them to this new land, they noticed the name emblazoned on its sides: "HMD Valinore." It was a fitting tribute to their journey and a symbol of the resilience and hope that defined their newfound nation.

## The Lady Grey

"The Lady Grey" is a colossal catastrophic snowstorm that shrouded Valinor not long after the introduction of the "Irminsul Generator." This relentless snowstorm endured for approximately 96 hours and resulted in a staggering 50% fatality rate among the elven population. "The Lady Grey" caused the temperature in northern Antares to plummet from a relatively "warm" -10°C to an extreme low of -200°C. The cold was so intense that certain magical abilities related to heat or fire became entirely ineffective, rendering the Irminsul Generator the sole source of warmth during the storm. Fortunately, the generator, though nearly on the verge of exploding, sustained only moderate damage.

The snowstorm not only claimed lives but also catalyzed profound transformations within elven society. Their traditionally long lifespans proved futile in the face of Nature's wrath. The once-secure magical forests became a thing of the past, replaced by the harsh and unpredictable environment of the northern wasteland. The idyllic notion that caring for nature would reciprocate that care dissipated, replaced by the stark reality that survival, not stewardship, was the primary concern in this unforgiving wilderness.

## Modern Valinor

In the aftermath of the storm, Valinor experienced rapid growth, marked by a surge in birth rates and the expansive development of cities. What were once mere refugee camps transformed into thriving cities for the elves. 

However, this newfound prosperity brought with it a new and formidable challenge—politics. As Valinor expanded, managing its growth and ensuring fair governance became increasingly complex. The lessons of their past, coupled with the need to adapt to their harsh new environment, continue to shape the political landscape of this new city-state.
