# Valinor

The **State of Valinor**, often referred to as **Valinor**, is a city-state located in the northernmost reaches of the Antares frozen wasteland. It serves as a beacon of warmth and vitality in a land dominated by harsh, icy conditions. Valinor is primarily populated by elves, many of whom are refugees from The Great Forest and Myrkheim, as well as political exiles seeking sanctuary from their homeland.

Valinor's survival in this hostile environment is made possible by the **Irminsul**, a monumental engine that generates the heat and energy required to keep the city-state alive. This marvel of engineering is crucial, as it combats the bitter cold of the wasteland's perpetual winter, ensuring the inhabitants of Valinor can endure the frozen landscape.

In addition to the Irminsul, Valinor is famed for its scholarly pursuits. The city-state boasts vast halls of study and a well-guarded library, which has recently opened its doors to the wider world. Scholars, students, and intellectuals from across Antares brave the treacherous journey to Valinor in pursuit of knowledge, drawn by the allure of its academic riches.

## Background

### Political Turmoil and Exile

Valinor's foundation is deeply rooted in the political upheaval that consumed the elven nations. Once admired for their rich cultural heritage, the elves' governments became increasingly authoritarian, with dissenters silenced or exiled. The oppressive regime twisted the elven identity into a tool for maintaining power, quashing opposition, and enforcing rigid ideological control across society.

Art, education, and even private life were shaped by propaganda, distorting the essence of elven culture to suit the whims of the ruling elite. Any who dared resist or speak out were branded as traitors, swiftly persecuted, and exiled.

### War and Resistance

During the height of the war between the elves and Londoners, internal resistance to the conflict was growing. The war, viewed by many as unjust, silenced dissent by conscripting critics and sending them to the frontlines. Elven resistance groups, however, managed to seize a significant military asset: an abandoned Dreadnought left behind by retreating London forces.

Despite the language barriers and the complexity of the technology, the resistance captured London soldiers and pieced together the dreadnought’s operations, transforming it into a tool of escape and survival.

### The Escape

Faced with the collapse of their homeland, the resistance gathered fellow elves and refugees to embark on a perilous journey to escape oppression. Using the captured Dreadnought as both transport and symbol of hope, they travelled through hostile lands, evading pursuit while struggling with internal tensions and the constant threat of betrayal.

After enduring months of peril and uncertainty, they finally reached the desolate frozen wastelands of northern Antares. The dreadnought, named **HMD Valinore**, became the foundation for their new nation.

## The Lady Grey

Shortly after the establishment of Valinor, a cataclysmic event occurred—**The Lady Grey**, a massive snowstorm that engulfed the region for 96 hours. Temperatures plummeted from -10°C to a fatal -200°C, causing catastrophic loss of life. During the storm, heat-based magic failed, leaving the **Irminsul Generator** as the only viable source of warmth. Though the generator was pushed to its limits, it narrowly avoided complete destruction.

The storm forced a profound cultural shift. Where once the elves believed in the harmonious stewardship of nature, the frozen wasteland taught them that survival required dominance over their environment. The elves' long lifespans provided little protection against the harsh realities of their new home, and the lesson was clear—nature would not nurture them, and only through control and ingenuity could they hope to survive.

### Aftermath

In the aftermath of **The Lady Grey**, Valinor rapidly transformed from a series of refugee camps into a thriving city-state. The Irminsul continued to power their society, and a surge in birth rates ensured the growth of their population.

However, with this expansion came new challenges. As Valinor's influence and size increased, so did the complexities of governance. The political landscape, shaped by lessons from their troubled past, has become a balancing act of maintaining order while adapting to the harsh conditions of their new homeland.
