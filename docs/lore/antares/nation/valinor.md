# Valinor

The **State of Valinor**, often referred to as **Valinor**, is a city-state located in the northernmost reaches of the Antares frozen wasteland. It serves as a beacon of warmth and vitality in a land dominated by harsh, icy conditions. Valinor is primarily populated by elves, many of whom are refugees from The Great Forest and Myrkheim, as well as political exiles seeking sanctuary from their homeland.

Valinor's survival in this hostile environment is made possible by the **Irminsul**, a monumental engine that generates the heat and energy required to keep the city-state alive. This marvel of engineering is crucial, as it combats the bitter cold of the wasteland's perpetual winter, ensuring the inhabitants of Valinor can endure the frozen landscape.

In addition to the Irminsul, Valinor is famed for its scholarly pursuits. The city-state boasts vast halls of study and a well-guarded library, which has recently opened its doors to the wider world. Scholars, students, and intellectuals from across Antares brave the treacherous journey to Valinor in pursuit of knowledge, drawn by the allure of its academic riches.

## History

### Political Turmoil and Exile

Valinor's foundation is deeply rooted in the political upheaval that consumed the elven nations. Once admired for their rich cultural heritage, the elves' governments became increasingly authoritarian, with dissenters silenced or exiled. The oppressive regime twisted the elven identity into a tool for maintaining power, quashing opposition, and enforcing rigid ideological control across society.

Art, education, and even private life were shaped by propaganda, distorting the essence of elven culture to suit the whims of the ruling elite. Any who dared resist or speak out were branded as traitors, swiftly persecuted, and exiled.

### War and Resistance

During the height of the war between the elves and Londoners, internal resistance to the conflict was growing. The war, viewed by many as unjust, silenced dissent by conscripting critics and sending them to the frontlines. Elven resistance groups, however, managed to seize a significant military asset: an abandoned Dreadnought left behind by retreating London forces.

Despite the language barriers and the complexity of the technology, the resistance captured London soldiers and pieced together the dreadnought's operations, transforming it into a tool of escape and survival.

### The Escape

Faced with the collapse of their homeland, the resistance gathered fellow elves and refugees to embark on a perilous journey to escape oppression. Using the captured Dreadnought as both transport and symbol of hope, they travelled through hostile lands, evading pursuit while struggling with internal tensions and the constant threat of betrayal.

After enduring months of peril and uncertainty, they finally reached the desolate frozen wastelands of northern Antares. The dreadnought, named **HMD Valinore**, became the foundation for their new nation.

## Lady Grey

Shortly after the establishment of Valinor, a cataclysmic event occurred—**The Lady Grey**, a massive snowstorm that engulfed the region for 96 hours. Temperatures plummeted from -10°C to a fatal -200°C, causing catastrophic loss of life. During the storm, heat-based magic failed, leaving the **Irminsul Generator** as the only viable source of warmth. Though the generator was pushed to its limits, it narrowly avoided complete destruction.

The storm forced a profound cultural shift. Where once the elves believed in the harmonious stewardship of nature, the frozen wasteland taught them that survival required dominance over their environment. The elves' long lifespans provided little protection against the harsh realities of their new home, and the lesson was clear—nature would not nurture them, and only through control and ingenuity could they hope to survive.

### Aftermath

In the aftermath of **The Lady Grey**, Valinor rapidly transformed from a series of refugee camps into a thriving city-state. The Irminsul continued to power their society, and a surge in birth rates ensured the growth of their population.

However, with this expansion came new challenges. As Valinor's influence and size increased, so did the complexities of governance. The political landscape, shaped by lessons from their troubled past, has become a balancing act of maintaining order while adapting to the harsh conditions of their new homeland.

## Government Structure

Valinor, though a city of scholars, keeps its government simple and efficient. As a small city-state, it doesn't need the complex bureaucracy of larger nations. Instead, it operates through several councils—representing scholars, artisans, military leaders, etc—that work together to govern the city.

Major decisions are often put to a vote, allowing citizens to have a direct say in important matters. This decentralised system ensures that power is shared, maintaining a balance between leadership and the city's academic spirit, while keeping Valinor independent and stable.

## Culture

### The Counter

Due to their long lifespans, elves perceive time quite differently from shorter-lived races. While a human might consider a decade to be significant, for an elf, it is but a drop in the ocean of their existence. However, during Valinor's first colonisation attempt, this perception proved fatal. In the deadly cold of Antares' northern wastes, where a single misstep could mean death within days, the elves were forced to change their way of thinking.

Their solution was a timekeeping system known as **The Counter**. Unlike traditional measures of time, The Counter does not track the passage of days or years. Instead, it counts each life lost. Every death raises The Counter by one, serving as a brutal yet effective reminder that they no longer live in the lush green forests of their past. This system reinforces the harsh reality of their new environment, where survival takes precedence over all else.

Though the elves now keep traditional time like other nations, **The Counter** is often displayed alongside it. As of today, it sits at 2,682.

### Land of Academics

Of all the races across Antares, none have guarded their knowledge as fiercely as the elves. Their ancient wisdom, bound in tomes and etched into scrolls, was once a closely held secret, often taken to the grave and lost to time. However, Valinor's rise as a city of academics did not stem from a noble desire to share this hidden knowledge. It was born from necessity.

Valinor needed a lifeline to the outside world if it was to do more than merely survive. Its remote location, engulfed in an endless winter, offered little in the way of natural resources. There were no bustling factories, no fertile land for crops, and no vibrant tourism industry—just an endless expanse of ice and snow. Trade routes passed far from Valinor, and the nation itself had little of tangible value to offer.

What the elves did possess were vast troves of books, scrolls, and records from their fallen empire—too valuable to destroy, yet useless for their immediate survival. Faced with these circumstances, the elves made a decision to send ambassadors to other nations and opened their archives to the world.

As a result, grand libraries and halls of learning were constructed, towering above all else the elves had built in the frozen wastes. These majestic structures symbolised Valinor's gamble—whether their decision to embrace academia would succeed or fail. In the end, it paid off, and Valinor emerged as the great city of knowledge it is known as today.
