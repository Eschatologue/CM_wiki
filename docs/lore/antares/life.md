# Life in Antares

## Biology

Antares is primarily inhabited by various humanoid races known as *Ordinaire*, which include Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, and, most commonly, Humans. However, London humans are considered distinct by Gallian scholars, referred to as *Abhumans*. 

Beyond these races, god-like beings or dragons called Aeginae once roamed the continent before mysteriously vanishing thousands of years ago. While most *Ordinaire* and *Abhumans* live within the protective Citadel Cities, the wilderness is stalked by Aberrations that prey upon them.

## Civilisation

Ancient civilisations predating the *Ordinaire* have largely faded into obscurity. Discoveries hint at a lost society called the *Precursors*, believed to have come from a place known as '**Eridu**'. However, the First Maelstorm erased much of their knowledge, pushing nearly all life to the edge of extinction.

### Politics

Antares' political landscape is diverse, with governments ranging from republics and theocracies to absolute monarchies. Much like the post-Cold War era, nations carefully navigate diplomacy to avoid another catastrophic war. 

The recent Dwarvish-London War highlights this fragile balance, though many groups—official, private, or illicit—work to maintain peace and aid those neglected by their rulers. Most nations are inwardly focused, intent on survival while defending against aberrations.

### Technology

Technology in Antares varies drastically across its nations, from medieval standards to the equivalent of the 1960s. Some nations still rely on horse-drawn transport, while others boast voidite-powered aircraft. Magic is present, though its accessibility depends on the region. This variance shapes how weapons and tools are used, with Gallian spellcasters, Myrkheim’s mechanical gadgets, Valinor’s magical archers, and London’s firearms setting each apart.

### Weapons & Warfare

Cold weapons—swords, spears, shields, and bows—remain the norm in Antares, often supplemented by dreadnoughts and magical conduits like arcane fusils and wands. Firearms and explosives, though rare, are primarily used by London, where revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are more common. Explosives see wider use, but firearms are seen as more of a Londoner tool or war trophy elsewhere.

### Culture

Antares' cultures mirror those of our world. London reflects the industrial strength of the British Empire, while Myrkheim is rooted in Norse and Germanic traditions. Valinor’s elves draw from Uralic cultures, blending mysticism with their connection to nature. Gallia’s aristocracy and rigid societal structures resemble post-revolutionary France. Soterrano fuses Swiss neutrality with the spiritual authority of Roman Catholicism, and Karakorum is a blend of Japanese, Chinese, and Mongolian cultures, represented in its seafaring fleets.
