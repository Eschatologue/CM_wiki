### Abhuman

*Races*

Abhumans, or Aberrant Humans, are a subgroup of humans, also known as "Londoners". Characterised by their human traits, they notably lack a connection to the Weave and possess a weaker physical constitution compared to other races found on Antares.

### Book of Grudge

*Culture, Myrkheim*

The Book of Grudge is not an actual book but a legendary compilation of civilisations, societies, and communities that have been destroyed (or are in the process of being destroyed) by the dwarves of Myrkheim. Each entry signifies a deep-seated grievance, marking those who have wronged the dwarves in any significant way. The concept serves as a powerful reminder that the dwarves are relentless in their pursuit of justice; to be inscribed within this "book" is to invite the wrath of Myrkheim upon you.

### Brabazon Fleet 

*Infrastructure, London*

The Brabazon Fleet is a series of colossal mobile penal colonies, constructed by London, that also function as mobile factories. These massive vessels house convicts, debtors, the poor, and the sick, all forced into relentless labour to fuel London’s industrial might. The denizens of the Fleet often refer to it as the "Brabazon Workworld," as once you enter, it becomes your entire world for life. Inhabitants work in brutal conditions, producing goods, maintaining machinery, and extracting resources from hazardous regions

### Citadel Cities

*Infrastructure*

*Citadel Cities* are the last bastions of civilization in Antares, formed by merging multiple urban centres into one heavily fortified enclave. Towering walls protect these cities, and venturing beyond them is perilous without careful preparation. Each nation builds its Citadel differently—some using advanced materials, others repurposing mountains or cave systems. A few nations rely on harsh natural conditions instead of fortified walls for protection.

### Cordite

*Substance*

*Cordite* is a powerful, volatile substance used to propel projectiles in firearms and other London-based weaponry. Refined from rare minerals found only in certain regions of Antares, it burns with immense energy, enabling the magic-less Londoners to rival the magical capabilities of other nations. While highly effective, Cordite is unstable, requiring careful handling and specialised equipment to manage its production and use. Its discovery and mastery have given the Londoners a distinct advantage in Antares.

However, Cordite rapidly becomes inert when in close proximity to those attuned to magic. This unique trait makes it unreliable for most non-Londoners, as even minor magical attunement neutralises its potency, rendering it ineffective and preventing its use in weapons or machinery.

> *"The discovery of Cordite was, ironically, a cruel accident of fate. Conceived by Elven alchemists as a weapon to obliterate Londoners, it was designed to be stable only in the hands of those bonded to magic, but volatile when near those who not. Yet, the plan backfired spectacularly when the Londoners learned to tame and weaponise it. What was intended to bring their ruin instead became the key to their military might—turning the tides and sealing the fate of those who sought their end."*

### Dreadnoughts

*Vehicle*

Colossal land-based locomotives pioneered by London, Dreadnoughts are vital for trade, transport, and communication across Antares. These vehicles connect nations and Citadel Cities, with some cities' survival relying on the trade routes they provide. Only a few nations can manufacture Dreadnoughts, leading others to acquire or rarely steal them. 

Comparable to real-world ships, they serve both combat and utility roles, akin to battleships, destroyers, or cargo vessels, but operate on land instead of sea.

### Imperial Spellcasting Standard

*System, Gallia*

A formalised system developed by Gallia that serves as the foundation for spellcasting practices across the empire and beyond. 

This comprehensive framework categorises spells according to their schools of magic, such as *Abjuration*, *Evocation*, and more, while also classifying their strength by level, ranging from 1 to 9. By establishing these standards, Gallia aimed to create a uniform approach to magic, facilitating training and ensuring consistency in spellcasting practices among its practitioners. 

Its influence on magical education and spellcasting remains evident throughout Antares, even after multidude of challenges.

### Irminsul

*Infrastructure, Valinor*

A massive steam-powered furnace-engine, serving as the primary source of heat and power in Valinor, it shields the last and only elven city from extinction by the relentless cold of the northern wastes.

---

### Isambard Line

*Infrastructure, London*

A continent-spanning suspended rail network. This monumental construction project was initiated by London with the assistance of Valinor to foster reconciliation following the Great Split. However, the project was ultimately abandoned due to the Great War, leaving behind scattered prefabricated sections across Antares.

### Millennium Dawn

*Era*

The Millennium Dawn marks the age that began 200 years after the Second Maelstorm, characterised by the fall of the Tahdenvalta Empire and the aftermath of the Great Split. 

This era signifies a new period for Antares, as societies adapt to the new balance of power, technology slowly replaces magic in every part of societies, and the remnants of the old world collide with the burgeoning innovations of the Londoners.

### Nomadic Cities

*Infrastructure*

Nomadic Cities are an innovative urban solution proposed by London to combat the increasing intensity of Warp Storms. Designed to eventually replace static Citadel Cities, these mobile urban centres would move according to needs and purpose, allowing them to evade Warp Storms before they strike.

### Ordinaire

*Races*

Ordinaire, or "ordinaries," are the majority of humanoid inhabitants in Antares, comprising Aasimar, Dwarves, Elves, Humans, Dragonborn, Halflings, Goliaths, Gnomes, Orcs, and Tieflings.

### Primordial Sea

*Geography*

A vast and perilous ocean surrounding Antares, notorious for its violent storms, catastrophic events, and the presence of incomprehensible beasts lurking in its depths. Largely unexplored and feared, the sea is avoided by most due to the extreme dangers it presents. Only the Karakorum Fleet has managed to navigate, tame, and settle its treacherous waters.

### The Gallian Standard System

*System, Gallia*

The Gallian Standard System, or *Le Système Gallien*, is a foundational framework for nation-building that served as a baseline for many nations prior to the Second Maelstorm. Originating from the imperial policies of Gallia, it encompasses guidelines for economic structures, political governance, and social organisation, promoting stability and order among diverse cultures. The system emphasises centralised authority, resource management, and a hierarchical approach to governance. 

Although largely abandoned, its influence can still be observed across various nations, manifesting in remnants of its economic models and governance structures.

### The Wilderness

*Region*

An umbrella term for the vast regions outside the Citadel Cities, The Wilderness encompasses a variety of landscapes, from lush fields and deep jungles to arid deserts, all inhabited by aberrations and other dangers. The farther one strays from the safety of the Citadel Cities, the more dangerous it becomes.
