# Life in Antares

## Biology

Antares is predominantly inhabited by various races, usually humanoids referred to as *Ordinaire* or Ordinary. This group includes a combination of various humanoids such as Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, and the most common one—Humans. However, humans hailing from London are categorized differently. Gallian scholars refer to these subgroups of humans as *Envahisseurs* or "Invaders." 

Aside from humanoids, there are god-like beings or dragons known as Aeginae. These majestic creatures used to roam the continent before mysteriously disappearing thousands of years ago. While the majority of *Ordinaire* and *Envahisseurs* are usually lives inside the protection of Citadel Cities, those who prey upon them such as Abberations, roams the Antares wilderness.

## Civilisation
Much of the history predating the *Ordinaire* (ordinary) has been lost, but clues of an ancient civilization referred to as the *Précurseur* (Forerunners) have been discovered. Recent findings suggest that these *Précurseur* originated from a place or location named 'Eridu'. However, details about Eridu remain scarce, and much of the knowledge about the *Précurseur* was lost when nearly all civilizations of Antares were brought to the brink of extinction by The First Maelstorm.

### Politics
The political landscape of Antares is highly diverse, with various forms of government adapted to the unique circumstances each nation faces. These range wildly from parliamentary republics and theocracies to absolute monarchies. The political climate is reminiscent of the post-Cold War era in our world, where nations engage in complex strategic maneuvers to avoid triggering a devastating war, knowing that recovery from such a conflict would be nearly impossible.

The recent Dwarvish-London War exemplifies this delicate balance, nearly pushing Antares' civilization to the edge of extinction. Despite this, many institutions—whether official, private, or illegal—strive to establish some semblance of peace and provide aid to those neglected by their governments. They work to prevent Antares from descending into another catastrophic conflict.

Most nations, however, are primarily focused on maintaining their own territories and fending off aberrations, making diplomatic interactions scarce and highly conservative. In this precarious environment, each nation plays a careful game of survival, trying to preserve their hold on what remains of this fractured continent.

#### Nation-state
The author of this wiki, being a history enthusiast, often draws inspiration from real-world nations and historical periods to create the civilizations in Antares. These nations sometimes combine elements from multiple cultures. For those who share the DM's interest, the parallels might be evident at first glance, but for everyone else, the unique blend adds depth to the world.

Antares is home to only six surviving nations or civilizations, each inspired by different cultures from our world:

1. **London**. Modeled after the British Empire at its colonial height, blending its influence as a global power with the tense atmosphere of the Cold War era.
2. **Myrkheimr**. Inspired by the Unification of Germany in 1886, classic dwarven fantasy elements, and Old Norse culture, creating a robust and resilient society.
3. **Gallia**. Based on France after the Revolution, with a twist—the revolution failed, and the aristocracy solidified its control, ruling with an iron fist.
4. **Karakorum**. The capital of the Mongol Empire, amalgamating cultural influences from Japan, China, and Mongolia. These cultures are represented as separate yet interconnected flagships within the nation.
5. **Soterrano**. A combination of the Papal States and pre-19th century Italy, highlighting the influence of organized crime akin to the Sicilian Mafia, but with powerful religious organizations replacing the criminal elements.
6. **Valinor**. Inspired by the Huguenot Exodus of the 17th century and elements from the game "Frostpunk." Add elves into the mix, and you have a huge mess that is already too late to change in the final draft.

### Technology
The technological landscape of Antares varies greatly among its nations, influencing the purpose and application of technology. While magic exists, its accessibility differs widely. Antares' technological spectrum ranges from the equivalent of the 1700s to the 1960s in our world. Some nations use traditional methods like horse-based transportation, while others have phlogiston-powered aircraft.

This diversity affects the weaponry and utilities used by individuals from different nations in this D&D campaign. Bandits from Gallia have powerful spellcasters despite their lack of education. Dwarven vagrants from Myrkheimr use heavy crossbows, boltcasters, warhammers, and various gadgets. Elves from Valinor combine arcane skills, guerrilla tactics, and marksmanship with longbows. London mercenaries use firearms to overwhelm foes with relentless streams of projectiles.

These technological disparities also shape the settings of towns and settlements, creating unique and distinctive environments.

#### Citadel Cities

Citadel cities stand as the primary means of civilization's survival amidst the harsh and perilous Antares wilderness. These cities amalgamate multiple urban centers, melding them into a singular, densely fortified enclave encircled by towering walls. They serve as the last strongholds of civilization within Antares. Venturing beyond these protective walls is ill-advised without extensive preparation and compelling reasons, as those who do so seldom return.

The construction of these fortifications varies among nations. Some nations craft their walls from highly resilient and sophisticated materials, while others repurpose existing mountain ranges and hills, using natural formations as fortifications. Certain civilizations establish their cities within mountains and caverns, fortifying cave entrances extensively. Others forego walls entirely, relying on colossal mobile ships or using the severe northern weather.

#### Dreadnoughts

Pioneered by the people of London, Dreadnoughts have become essential for transportation, communication, and trade between the nations and citadel cities of Antares. These colossal locomotives are vital for the survival and prosperity of many cities. Not all nations can manufacture them; some acquire designs or steal Dreadnoughts, though this is rare.

Constructed from reinforced wood or metal plating and powered by various engines, Dreadnoughts are heavily armoured and surprisingly swift. Resembling moving fortresses, they balance protection, mobility, and firepower, with some tailored for warfare and others for transportation.

Only two nations in Antares can reliably produce their own Dreadnoughts. London leads with the largest fleet, while Myrkheimr has adapted London's designs for their dwarven stature. Other nations modify purchased Dreadnoughts to suit their needs: Gallian models feature siege-class arcane weaponry, Soterrani models are equipped for underground exploration, and Valinorian models have increased insulation for harsh weather.

If drawing a comparison to real-life, Dreadnoughts are essentially akin to ships: Battlehips and Destroyers translate to their combat-oriented counterparts, while cargo ships or cruise ships mirroring their roles in transportation and utility, all operating on land rather than water.

### Weapons & Warfare
The majority of nations in Antares typically rely on traditional cold weapons such as swords, spears, shields, bows, and crossbows, alongside the utilization of Dreadnoughts which serve a role akin to naval warships and spellbound weaponrs such as arcane fusils and wands as a spellcasting conduits. While firearms and explosives do exist, they are predominantly utilized by London. Explosives, in particular, are more commonly used compared to firearms.

Due to the challenges involved in their manufacture, firearms are a rarity in Antares. Handguns such as semi-automatic pistols and revolvers are more prevalent, but they are often viewed as war trophies rather than practical weapons by anyone other than humans from London.
