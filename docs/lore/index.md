# Welcome to Crown and Misery

*Beneath the shattered moon, across the wilderness expanse, a band of misadvanturers races against death itself. The swarm draws near–it hunger not just for flesh, but also for additions to their ranks.*{.quote}

*Within the walls of Maginot, an archmage slumps in frustration. Weeks of tireless research, and still the latest ward holds for mere hours against the swarm. The city stands—for now. But she must begin again before the next tide arrives.*{.quote}

*As the sun sinks below the horizon and night falls once more, weary soldiers finish tending their rifles. They take their posts in silence, wounded yet unwavering—one more night, they pray, until reinforcements arrive.*{.quote}

*The sensors shriek in garbled static, warning the prospectors of what lies ahead. The air reeks of death. Still, they march onward. Riches, after all, often bear the same stench.*{.quote}

The world of Crown and Misery is built upon a broken land. On this hollowed continent, time ticks ever forward as all things inch toward the yawning void. This is no longer an age for heroes, but for battered souls that still choose to fight for the last flickers of hope. Good people commit evil acts. Evils serve the greater good. The world is painted in a hundred shades of grey.

Magic permeates the land—subtle, ever-present—but not all are granted the privilege of touching the Weave. Some are denied by birth, others by circumstance, and a few are barred entirely. Even the lowliest life can muster a spark of spellcraft, yet those cut off from the arcane must seek salvation elsewhere. And that *elsewhere...* may well shape the future of this dying continent.

It is common knowledge that Antares harbours countless mysteries, its history as deep and unfathomable as the abyss itself—yet no scholar has managed more than a scratch upon its surface. The land is strewn with ancient ruins, derelict temples, and structures beyond comprehension. But as the Warp Storms grow ever more violent, they threaten to erase what little remains of the unknown world. 

So, welcome to **Crown and Misery**—a post-apocalyptic science fantasy veined with noir and steeped in dystopia. Stories here don't always end well, and no choice comes without cost. From the labyrinthine urban sprawl of the Citadel Cities to the continent-sized graveyard that is the wilderness, hidden threats lurk in every shadow. But so too do opportunities—for those willing to brave the risk, there may yet be something greater waiting beyond the ruins.

## Things to Know

What is *Crown & Misery*? Here are the key things to know:

1. **Setting**{.inl} While **Forgotten Realms** is your classic *Heroic Fantasy*, **Eberron** is *Post-War Fantasy*, and **Ravenloft** is *Gothic Horror*, the **Crown & Misery** setting is *Post-Apocalyptic Science Fantasy*—a world of radiation-poisoned wastelands, magic-dead zones, scavenged tech, and lingering horrors that refuse to die.

2. **Warp Storms**{.inl} An umbrella term for the common cataclysmic disasters that define life in Antares—violent tempests, reality-warping anomalies, and dimensional rifts. They are unpredictable, devastating, and often fatal. Some scholars call them the world's immune response; others believe they are the prelude to its final death.

3. **The Eight Nations**{.inl} In ages past, this continent was a patchwork of kingdoms and city-states. Today, only eight nations remain, each ruling over multiple massive fortified urban centres known as *Citadel Cities*. These are the last bastions of civilisation—survivors of centuries of collapse, now locked in cold alliances, trade wars, and silent sieges.

4. **The Industrial Revolution**{.inl} The Warp Storms didn't just bring ruin—they brought *change*. Entire new sciences and technologies emerged from the wreckage. While some cling to tradition, many have embraced this new age, finding ways to harness the Warp's chaos. To live in Antares now is to accept that survival means adaptation—even if it comes at great cost.
