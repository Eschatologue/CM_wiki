# Introduction

Welcome to the Lore page of **Crown & Misery**. Witness the DM's coffee-induced, self-hatred-fueled writing extravaganza in its full capacity. This page introduces you to what **Crown & Misery** is all about, its overall theme and feel, and the basics of the world. Sit tight, and enjoy what I have cooked.

## Settings

**Crown & Misery** (shortened to **CM** from now on) doesn't fit neatly into one genre—it draws on multiple themes to create a complex and layered experience. At its core, CM is a **Post-Apocalyptic Science Fantasy**, but each of those elements brings its own nuance and flavour:

### Post-Apocalyptic

The world has already ended—twice, in fact. But this isn't the Fallout-style post-apocalypse where society has collapsed and everything is a wasteland. Instead, CM's world is built upon the ruins of its previous incarnations. The civilisations of today have used the remnants of the past as the foundation for new growth, rising from the bones of what came before. While some nations may be shadows of their former glory, the overall theme isn't one of regression, but of progress—however flawed or painful that may be.

Rather than being stuck in a dystopian mire, the people of Antares are struggling forward, trying to rebuild and reimagine their world even as the echoes of past calamities linger. It's a world scarred by history but not consumed by it. Here, the focus is on the **resilience** of those who survive, on the relentless march toward the future—even if that future is uncertain or dangerous.

### Science Fantasy

Unlike the typical D&D setting, which leans heavily on traditional high fantasy with magic, dragons, and medieval kingdoms, **Crown & Misery** is firmly rooted in **Science Fantasy**. This means the world isn't just shaped by magic and mythical creatures—it's a place where technology and science have advanced in tandem with, and sometimes in opposition to, magical forces.

In **CM**, ancient spells and arcane forces still exist, but they're now competing with industrial machines, firearms, and crude versions of modern technology. Think of it as a world where wizards might carry revolvers, and factories churn out machines powered by strange, otherworldly energies. It's a blend of old-world magic and new-world invention, where spellbooks sit alongside blueprints, and swordplay coexists with firearms.

What makes CM stand apart is this *fusion* of the mystical and the mechanical. Magic hasn't disappeared—it's evolved, and so has the technology that intertwines with it. London, for example, leads the charge in industrialisation, creating a society where machines rival the power of the arcane, and other nations are starting to follow suit.

**Please don't confuse this with modern 5e settings**{.inl} While modern 5e worlds might feature steampunk elements or even modern-day conveniences like airships, mobile communication, or magitech, CM is **not** about contemporary or futuristic technology. The technology in this world is crude and experimental, much closer to the **early Industrial Revolution** than anything resembling modern-day or futuristic tech. Guns are restrictive, unreliable tools, and while some nations are embracing machines, magic still holds a firm grip over much of the world.

The difference lies in the gritty, **pre-modern** feel of CM's world. You won't find sleek, fully-automated machines or widespread use of magic to power technological marvels. Instead, this is a world in transition, where the clash between old magic and new inventions is messy, imperfect, and filled with uncertainty.

## Inspirations

I didn't pull all of this theming from my ass. The creation of this world is a reflection of the various games, particularly those with deep world-building elements. **Crown & Misery** draws heavily on these influences, especially in how it approaches atmosphere and complexity. Games like **Arknights** have helped shape the overall tone, adding layers of grim survival and societal struggle to the setting. Meanwhile, the lore and appendices from **D&D** documents provide the structural system for the campaign. After all, it's still D&D—there's no escaping dragons (Foreshadowing).
