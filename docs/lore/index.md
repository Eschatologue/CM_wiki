# Introduction

Welcome to the Lore page of **Crown & Misery**. Witness the DM's coffee-induced, self-hatred-fueled writing extravaganza in its full capacity. This page introduces you to what **Crown & Misery** is all about, its overall theme and feel, and the basics of the world. Sit tight, and enjoy what I have cooked.

## Theme

**Crown & Misery** (shortened to **CM** from now on) doesn’t fit neatly into one genre—it draws on multiple themes to create a complex and layered experience. At its core, CM is a **Post-Apocalyptic Science Fantasy**, but each of those elements brings its own nuance and flavour. Let’s break it down:

#### Post-Apocalyptic

The world has already ended—twice, in fact. But this isn’t the Fallout-style post-apocalypse where society has collapsed and everything is a wasteland. Instead, CM’s world is built upon the ruins of its previous incarnations. The civilisations of today have used the remnants of the past as the foundation for new growth, rising from the bones of what came before. While some nations may be shadows of their former glory, the overall theme isn’t one of regression, but of progress—however flawed or painful that may be.

Rather than being stuck in a dystopian mire, the people of Antares are struggling forward, trying to rebuild and reimagine their world even as the echoes of past calamities linger. It’s a world scarred by history but not consumed by it. Here, the focus is on the **resilience** of those who survive, on the relentless march toward the future—even if that future is uncertain or dangerous.

#### Science Fantasy

Here’s where things get interesting. Unlike the typical D&D setting, which leans heavily on traditional high fantasy with magic, dragons, and medieval kingdoms, **Crown & Misery** is firmly rooted in **Science Fantasy**. This means the world isn’t just shaped by magic and mythical creatures—it’s a place where technology and science have advanced in tandem with, and sometimes in opposition to, magical forces.

In **CM**, ancient spells and arcane forces still exist, but they’re now competing with industrial machines, firearms, and crude versions of modern technology. Think of it as a world where wizards might carry revolvers, and factories churn out machines powered by strange, otherworldly energies. It’s a blend of old-world magic and new-world invention, where spellbooks sit alongside blueprints, and swordplay coexists with firearms.

What makes CM stand apart is this *fusion* of the mystical and the mechanical. Magic hasn’t disappeared—it’s evolved, and so has the technology that intertwines with it. London, for example, leads the charge in industrialisation, creating a society where machines rival the power of the arcane, and other nations are starting to follow suit.

**Please don’t confuse this with modern 5e settings.** While modern 5e worlds might feature steampunk elements or even modern-day conveniences like airships, mobile communication, or magitech, CM is **not** about contemporary or futuristic technology. The technology in this world is crude and experimental, much closer to the **early Industrial Revolution** than anything resembling modern-day or futuristic tech. Guns are restrictive, unreliable tools, and while some nations are embracing machines, magic still holds a firm grip over much of the world.

The difference lies in the gritty, **pre-modern** feel of CM’s world. You won’t find sleek, fully-automated machines or widespread use of magic to power technological marvels. Instead, this is a world in transition, where the clash between old magic and new inventions is messy, imperfect, and filled with uncertainty.

## Inspirations

I didn’t pull all of this theming from my ass. The creation of this world is a reflection of the various games I’ve played, particularly those with deep world-building elements. **Crown & Misery** draws heavily on these influences, especially in how it approaches atmosphere and complexity. Games like **Arknights** have helped shape the overall tone, adding layers of grim survival and societal struggle to the setting. Meanwhile, the lore and appendices from **D&D** documents provide the structural system for the campaign. After all, it’s still D&D—there’s no escaping dragons.

But the nations within **CM** are where the world truly comes to life, each of them inspired by different themes, games, and historical contexts.

***London or Albion.*** London is essentially an alternate version of our world’s Britain, but it never reached the level of modernity we know. Instead, it’s a gritty, industrialised nation with a **dieselpunk** aesthetic. London is very British in nature, but it’s defined by its relentless push for technological advancement. Since they can’t use magic like other nations, their survival depends on innovation. London is under immense pressure to stay ahead in technological curve, or risk being decimated by those who do wield magic. This need for progress drives much of London’s identity—its machines and inventions are its lifeline in a world increasingly dominated by magic.

***Gallia.*** Gallia stands in stark contrast to London, resisting the tide of machines and technology while striving for its own form of progress. The nation draws inspiration from the aftermath of the French Revolution, but in this version, the nobility emerged victorious. As a result, Gallia is sharply divided by a clear line between the aristocracy and the common folk, with strict social hierarchies that are maintained through both magical and political power. The nobles control the flow of magic, wielding it as a symbol of their superiority, while the common people are largely kept at bay, unable to access the higher forms of magic that define Gallian society.

***Myrkheim.*** The land of the dwarves, Myrkheim is sandwiched between London and Gallia, and the nation embodies a delicate balance of progress and tradition. It draws inspiration from the **Sengoku Jidai** era of Japan and the **Unification of Germany** in Europe. Myrkheim’s internal politics are dominated by powerful clans, each with their own stance on whether to adopt Gallia’s magical traditions or London’s technological advancements. Ultimately, the dwarves chose a middle path, embracing elements of both, with a unique **steampunk** twist in their culture. They’re both innovators and traditionalists, blending old-world craftsmanship with new industrial tools.

***Valinor.*** Imagine **Frostpunk**, but with elves, and now add the concept of a city devoted to knowledge, learning, and scholarship. Valinor is a frozen, desolate land where survival is the top priority, but the elves have made it a beacon of wisdom and intellect amidst the harsh cold. The entire city functions as a centre of research and arcane study, with libraries, observatories, and academies dominating the landscape. The elves here are driven not just by the need to survive but also by their insatiable thirst for knowledge, which they believe holds the key to mastering the world’s unforgiving environment. Every decision in Valinor, from the distribution of resources to the prioritisation of research, walks a fine line between scholarly pursuit and the brutal realities of their environment.

***Soterrano.*** Take the **Papal States**, sprinkle in divine magic, and move it all underground—welcome to Soterrano. It’s a bustling subterranean holy city, with divine magic woven into its very fabric. Despite its strong religious and magical foundation, the nation functions politically more like **Switzerland**. It stays neutral in most conflicts by playing both sides, maintaining its influence through diplomacy rather than force. Its divine power gives it leverage, but its neutrality keeps it secure.

***Karakorum.*** Every fantasy setting needs its version of the East, but I didn’t want the typical approach. Karakorum isn’t a static landmass—it’s a mobile nation. Imagine **Noah’s Ark**, but it’s three sprawling nations housed on colossal ships, endlessly traversing the oceans surrounding Antares. These nomadic nations maintain their cultures while navigating the dangers of the open sea, blending exploration and survival into their very way of life. It’s not just a nation—it’s an entire civilisation in constant motion.
