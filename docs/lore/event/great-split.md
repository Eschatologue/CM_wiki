# The Great Split

The Great Split was a significant conflict between the **Tähdenvalta Empire** (also known as the Elven Empire) and the **Union of Britain** (London). This war marked a pivotal shift in the balance of power on the continent of Antares, leading to the complete capitulation of the Elven Empire and the emergence of London as a major power.

## Background

The Great Split originated from escalating tensions between the Tähdenvalta Empire and London. Initially, the elves had extended sanctuary to the Londoners, but as London’s influence expanded, the elves perceived them as a growing threat and with Elven political dynamics shifted towards extremism and nationalism, it leads to increasingly aggressive actions against the British government. The conflict was exacerbated by environmental concerns, as extensive deforestation caused by London’s expansion into elven territories provoked further hostility.

## Scale and Strategy

The Great Split was not merely a series of battles; it was a clash between two fundamentally different ways of life. The elves, with their deep connection to the natural world and magic, fought with precision and finesse. Each soldier was a master of their craft, whether it was archery, swordsmanship, or spellcasting. The elves believed that the strength of their individual warriors would carry them to victory.

In contrast, the Londoners approached the war with a mindset of efficiency and pragmatism. They mass-produced firearms and mechanical war construct, deploying them in large numbers to overwhelm their opponents. While an elven archer could hit a target from hundreds of metres away, a Londoner rifleman could fire hundreds of bullets in the same time it took the archer to nock an arrow. The Londoners’ strategy was not about individual heroics but about sheer numbers, coordination, and the power of technology.

## Course of the War

The war was characterised by its unprecedented brutality and swift resolution. The Elven Empire, with its emphasis on magical and tactical warfare, was unprepared for the industrial and mechanised warfare capabilities of London. Though shorter than most war in Antares, it was extremely violent, with both sides suffering significant losses. London’s ability to rapidly produce and deploy advanced war machines, coupled with their strategic innovations, overwhelmed the elves, whose conventional tactics proved inadequate against such a unconventional opponent.

## Aftermath

The aftermath of the Great Split had profound effects on Antares. The destruction of the Tree of Life, also known as Yggdrasil, and the fall of the Elven Empire marked the end of an era of magical dominance. The remnants of the Elven political leadership were hunted down, leading to a complete dissolution of their governance.

The defeat of the elves and the subsequent rise of London had far-reaching cultural and social implications. Across Antares, the notion of a non-magical faction defeating a formidable magical empire was met with widespread incredulity and shock. The obliteration of a long-standing magical power was a profound cultural shock, as magic had long been considered the preeminent force in the world.

The spread of imagery depicting London’s advanced war machinery further amplified the astonishment. These depictions, capturing the scale and sophistication of London’s technology, were a stark contrast to the traditional and magical warfare methods of the era, profoundly influencing the perception of technological advancements on the continent.

## Legacy

The Great Split reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Antares, establishing London as a dominant power and effectively ending the Elven Empire’s influence. The war’s legacy continues to be a subject of historical study and reflection, highlighting the dramatic shift from magical to industrial warfare and the resultant transformation of regional power dynamics.
