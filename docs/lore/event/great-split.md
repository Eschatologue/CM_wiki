# The Great Split

**The Great Split** was a pivotal conflict between the **Tähdenvalta Empire** (Elven Empire) and the **Union of Britain** (London), marking the first major clash between raw arcane and natural power with industrialised warfare. The conflict primarily occurred in the vast forestlands that once stood as a symbol of the Elven Empire's natural dominion, now entirely under London’s control. Characterised by unprecedented brutality, the war saw the employment of diverse and devastating tactics, ranging from necromancy, dark magic, and mind control to heavy artillery bombardments, mechanical war constructs, and chemical weapons. Although the war was brief, it was among the deadliest in the history of Antares, resulting in the total collapse of the Elven Empire and the rise of London as a significant power in the region. 

## Background

For decades, tensions between the Tähdenvalta Empire and London had been escalating. As London expanded its industrial and territorial ambitions, the elves perceived this as a direct threat to their ancient traditions and dominion over the natural world. The growing influence of London’s technology, coupled with their refusal to share advancements, fueled elven nationalism and resentment. These sentiments manifested in a series of covert operations by the elves, including the abduction and enslavement of British citizens, which were seen as a prelude to a larger conflict. Additionally, London's deforestation efforts to support its industrial growth further exacerbated hostilities, with the elves viewing this as an assault on their sacred lands and way of life.

## Prelude

In the lead-up to the war, both sides engaged in increasingly hostile actions. The elves, leveraging their mastery of arcane arts, infiltrated British territories, claiming these incursions were part of their effort to reclaim ancestral lands. London, anticipating a broader conflict, responded by fortifying its borders and initiating a military build-up. Attempts at diplomacy were made, but these were undermined by mutual distrust and uncompromising positions. As provocations escalated, including several border skirmishes and sabotage attempts, the path to war became unavoidable. Both sides prepared for a confrontation that neither fully understood, with the elves confident in their magical supremacy and the British determined to assert their industrial might.

## Progress of the War

The Great Split unfolded with a level of brutality never before seen in Antares. The clash between the elves' magic and London's industrial might defined the conflict. While the elves initially held the advantage with their arcane prowess, the British quickly adapted, using their experience in warfare and advanced technology to counter the elves' strategies. The war was characterised by devastating battles, where the elves' traditional wood and earth-based defences were shattered by London's steel and firepower. Despite fierce resistance, the elves were gradually pushed back, unable to match the relentless efficiency of the British war machine. Atrocities were committed on both sides, with many remaining unreported or shrouded in secrecy.

### The Great Blight

The Great Blight was a devastating event during the war, where elven forces sabotaged London’s farms by poisoning crops with a potent magical toxin. This poison not only destroyed the food supply but also twisted those who consumed it, turning them into mindless, savage creatures driven by an insatiable hunger. The situation became so dire that Londoners were forced to kill their own to prevent the spread of the blight. The psychological and physical toll of this event was immense, further intensifying the brutal nature of the conflict.

### The Titans of Pleghestos

As part of London's broader strategy to demoralise and overwhelm the elven forces, London deployed their mechanical war constructs, or mechs, in a series of assaults on elven cities. The event known as "The Titans of Pleghestos" saw these mechs, armed with flamethrowers, dropped from airships directly into undefended elven settlements. The result was catastrophic: entire cities were reduced to smouldering ruins, and countless elven civilians were killed.

### The Siege of Yllfasera

The Siege of Yllfasera marked the final, chapter of the Great Split. Over the course of two relentless weeks, London unleashed a continuous artillery bombardment upon the elven capital, a city once renowned for its beauty and the sacred Tree of Life at its heart. The elves, with their magic and nature-based defences, were unprepared for the sheer scale of the attack.

The bombardment was merciless, with no respite day or night. Ancient trees, homes, and the very earth itself were shattered under the relentless barrage of explosive shells. The Tree of Life became the primary target for London’s forces. Despite the best efforts of the elves to protect it, the tree eventually succumbed to the overwhelming firepower, its fall sending shockwaves through the elven ranks and marking the end of their resistance.

The destruction of the Tree of Life was more than a strategic victory for London; it was a psychological blow from which the elves could not recover. As the capital city burned and crumbled, the remaining elven forces were left in disarray, their spirits broken by the loss of their most sacred site. The siege effectively ended the war, as the fall of the capital signaled the complete collapse of the Tähdenvalta Empire.

## Aftermath

The aftermath of the Great Split was devastating for the Elven Empire. The destruction of the Tree of Life (Yggdrasil), a sacred symbol of the elven connection to nature, signified the end of their dominion. The tree’s destruction also marked the ascension of Sri the Harmony, a mysterious entity whose rise further destabilised the remnants of the empire. With their leadership decimated and their lands occupied, the remaining political leaders of the Tähdenvalta Empire were hunted down, effectively ending their reign.

The victory of London sent shockwaves across Antares. The notion that a faction without magic could defeat the mighty Elven Empire was previously unthinkable, and the implications were profound, as the once-dominant belief in the supremacy of magic was shattered. The spread of paintings depicting London's war machines further intensified this shock, as societies across Antares struggled to comprehend what monstrosities had emerged. The war fundamentally altered the balance of power in Antares, with London now seen as a major force to be reckoned with.

## Casualties

The Great Split resulted in catastrophic losses on both sides. It is estimated that tens of thousands of elves perished during the conflict, with many more displaced, enslaved, or otherwise traumatised in the aftermath. Entire elven cities were razed, and the once-vast forests that defined their empire were left in ruins. London, too, suffered significant casualties, though their losses were somewhat mitigated by their industrial capacity to replenish their forces. The war also led to widespread civilian suffering, with countless lives disrupted by the conflict's devastation. The long-term impact on the civilian population, including the loss of homes, livelihoods, and cultural heritage, was profound, leaving deep scars that would take generations to heal.
