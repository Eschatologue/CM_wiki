# Dwarvish-London War

**The Dwarvish-London War**, also referred to as **The Great War**, was an open conflict between the **Dominion of Albion** (London) and the **Republic of Myrkheim**. Emerging from territorial disputes following the collapse of the Elven Empire, the war saw the Republic of Myrkheim encountering an unexpected and formidable opponent, which concluded with a decisive victory for London, resulting in significant shifts in the power dynamics of the continent.

## Background

The origins of the war can be traced to the aftermath of the Elven Empire's decline, which left vast territories open to contestation. The Republic of Myrkheim, known for its long history of military expertise and conquests, sought to expand its influence into these lands. At this time, London was a relatively unknown entity to the dwarves, who perceived its people as little more than well-organised raiders. However, London had already established its presence in these areas and was prepared to defend its claims.

## Prelude

In the period leading up to the war, Myrkheim initiated a series of advances into the disputed territories, encountering resistance from forces they initially underestimated. The early confrontations were characterised by small-scale skirmishes and political manoeuvering, with the dwarves confident in their ability to secure quick victory. However, as the scale of these encounters grew, it became evident that London's capabilities were far more sophisticated than Myrkheim had anticipated. Despite these signs, the dwarves continued their push, unaware of the full extent of the challenge they were about to face.

## Progress of the War

As the war continues London's forces, employing never-seen before military strategies and technologies, launched a series of coordinated assaults that overwhelmed Myrkheim's defences. The war saw the extensive use of mechanised units, artillery, and mobile factories by London, which contrasted sharply with the more conventional warfare tactics employed by the dwarves.

Despite their experience and well-fortified positions, the dwarves struggled to counter London's rapid advances and logistical efficiency. The Republic of Myrkheim found itself increasingly on the defensive as London's forces pressed their advantage across multiple fronts.

### The Dragon Gambit

In a final effort to shift the momentum of the war, Myrkheim's leaders decided to unleash **Tiamat**, an ancient and powerful dragon that had been sealed away for generations. The dwarves hoped that the destructive power of Tiamat would be enough to halt London's advance and turn the tide of the conflict in their favour.

However, London responded by deploying an experimental weapon of unprecedented destructive capability. In a single, devastating strike, the weapon obliterated Tiamat, rendering the dwarves' last desperate strategy ineffective. The destruction of Tiamat marked a turning point in the war, leading to the eventual cessation of hostilities as Myrkheim recognised the futility of further resistance.

## Aftermath

The war concluded with the formal surrender of the Republic of Myrkheim, signalling a significant reordering of power in Antares. The conflict underscored the effectiveness of London's military strategies, particularly its reliance on industrialised warfare, and demonstrated the limitations of more traditional approaches in the face of such tactics.

For Myrkheim, the war led to a period of introspection and rebuilding. The events highlighted the need for adaptation in a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. The broader implications of the war were felt across Antares, as neighbouring nations took note of the emerging dominance of London and the shifting balance of power in the region.

## Casualties

The Dwarvish-London War, though relatively short in duration, resulted in significant casualties, particularly among the forces of Myrkheim which saw the destruction and annexation of numerous dwarven strongholds. London's casualties were comparatively minimal, reflecting the asymmetry in the capabilities and strategies of the two sides.
