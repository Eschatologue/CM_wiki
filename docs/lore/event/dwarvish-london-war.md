# Dwarvish-London War

**The Dwarvish-London War** or also called **The Great War** was a significant conflict between the Union of Britain (London) and the Republic of Myrkheim in Antares. Initially beginning as a series of skirmishes, the war escalated into a full-scale conflict that ultimately resulted in London’s decisive victory.

## Background

The war emerged from growing tensions between Myrkheim and London. The dwarves of Myrkheim, known for their deep experience in warfare and fortified strongholds, initially viewed London’s unconventional methods with scepticism. Early confrontations were minor, consisting of border skirmishes and raids. However, it soon became apparent that London’s military strategy was unlike anything the dwarves had encountered.

While Myrkheim relied on the well-established combat tactics and robust defences that had served them for centuries, London introduced mechanised units, advanced artillery, and a strategic emphasis on mass production. This divergence in military doctrine rapidly escalated the conflict, pushing both sides into a prolonged and intense war.

## Course of the War

As the conflict progressed, London’s military sophistication became increasingly evident. Their use of mechanised infantry, armoured vehicles, and mobile factories capable of producing weapons and supplies on the battlefield provided them with a strategic advantage. In contrast, Myrkheim’s conventional tactics and defences, while formidable, were ill-equipped to counter the sheer scale and coordination of London’s war effort.

London’s forces, characterised by their mobility and overwhelming firepower, systematically dismantled Myrkheim’s defences. The dwarves, despite their combat experience, struggled to adapt to the rapid advances and logistical efficiency demonstrated by London’s military.

### The Dragon Gambit

In a final effort to turn the tide of the war, Myrkheim’s leadership decided to release **Tiamat**, an ancient and powerful dragon sealed away for generations. The dwarves believed that Tiamat’s destructive power would be sufficient to halt London’s advance and secure a victory.

However, in response, London deployed an experimental weapon called **Project Tube Alloy**, a weapon of unprecedented destructive capability. The weapon obliterated Tiamat in a single strike, emitting a blinding flash and explosion like no other that forever alters the terrain, turning it into an inhospitable wasteland. The destruction of Tiamat marked a turning point in the war, leading Myrkheim to recognise the futility of further resistance.

## Aftermath

The Dwarvish-London War concluded with the surrender of Myrkheim, marking a significant shift in the balance of power in Antares. London’s victory underscored the effectiveness of industrialised warfare, setting a new standard for military conflict on the continent.

For Myrkheim, the war led to a period of reflection and rebuilding. The defeat highlighted the limitations of their traditional strategies in the face of London’s technological superiority. The broader impact of the Ironhelm War was felt across Antares, as other nations observed the transformative potential of London’s approach to warfare, signalling the beginning of a new era in the region’s history.
