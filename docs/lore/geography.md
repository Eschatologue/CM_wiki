# Geopolitics and Geography

In the present era, Antares is home to merely **six** surviving nations, leaving vast stretches of uncharted and unexplored territories beyond their borders. This charted expanse encompasses diverse landmasses, each characterized by distinct biomes and ecological patterns.

## Overview

Antares is a continent of contrasts, featuring expansive deserts, fertile plains, towering mountain ranges, and dense rainforests. The geography of Antares profoundly shapes its geopolitical landscape, dictating the survival and prosperity of its six remaining nations. The dangerous wildlife that inhabits these untamed lands makes much of the fertile regions uninhabitable, forcing populations to reside within the fortified Citadel cities.

## Key Geographical Features

### Deserts and Plains

Antares is dominated by vast arid deserts and lush plains. These fertile regions, although promising, are perilous due to the presence of dangerous wildlife. London and the surface region of Sotterano partially control some of these areas, but beyond the Citadel cities' protective walls, these lands remain largely uninhabited.

### Mountain Ranges

A major mountain range spans the continent from north to south, passing through the dwarven nation of Myrkheimr. This natural barrier is a defining feature of Antares and plays a crucial role in the continent's geography.

### The Underdark

To the west of the mountain range lies the 'Underdark,' a vast expanse of subterranean caverns. Much of Sotterano resides within this underground realm, which remains largely unexplored by the majority of Antares' inhabitants.

### Eastern Regions

East of the mountain range is Gallia, a realm rich in magic and sorcery, often mockingly referred to as "The French" by the Londoners. Gallia's southwestern territories are covered in lush rainforests. 

### Western Regions

The area now occupied by London was once dense with forests, but these were largely cleared for building materials following a victorious war against the elves.

### Northern Territories

Valinor, located in the distant north, serves as a sanctuary for elven refugees. This region is one of the few places in northern Antares that can be described as "warm," offering a rare respite from the continent's harsh climate.

## Coastal Regions and Oceans

Antares is surrounded by a seemingly boundless ocean, with its coastlines continually reshaped by destructive tsunamis caused by Warp storms. In this chaotic maritime environment, the Karakorum people navigate the ever-changing coastlines using a fleet of three constantly moving flagships, having discerned some patterns in the tumultuous seas.
