# Geopolitics and Geography

In the present era, Antares is home to merely **six** surviving nations, leaving vast stretches of uncharted and unexplored territories beyond their borders. This charted expanse encompasses diverse landmasses, each characterized by distinct biomes and ecological patterns.

Stretching across the continent, Antares boasts expansive arid deserts and lush plains that dominate much of its land area, with some of the most fruitful areas falling under the partial control of London and the surface region of Sotterano. Yet, due to the perilous wildlife that roams the untamed lands, these fertile expanses remain largely uninhabited beyond the protective walls of Citadel cities.

Running extensively from Antares' northern reaches to its southern extremities is a large mountain range, passing through the dwarven nation of Mykrrheim. To the west of these peaks, a vast expanse of subterranean caverns known as the 'Underdark' stretches beneath the land. While much of Sotterano finds its home within this realm, the Underdark remains a largely uncharted frontier for the majority of Antares' inhabitants.

On the eastern side of this mountain range lies Gallia, a realm steeped in magic and sorcery, often mockingly referred to as "The French" by the Londoners. Within Gallia's dominion, lush rainforests flourish in the southwestern territories. In contrast, where London now stands, once vast forests once thrived. However, the majestic trees of this region have largely fallen victim to the expansionist ambitions of Londoners, who used them as building materials after a victorious war against the elves.

Nestled in the distant north, Valinor stands as a haven for elven refugees, providing a rare respite from the continent's often harsh climate. It's one of the few places in northern Antares that could even remotely be described as "warm."

Antares is enveloped by a seemingly boundless ocean, its coastlines forever altered by the relentless onslaught of destructive tsunamis brought forth by the warp storms. Amid this chaotic maritime environment, the Karakorum people have managed to discern some semblance of a pattern. Operating a fleet of three constantly moving flagships, they navigate the continent's ever-changing coastlines.
