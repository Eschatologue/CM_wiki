# Antares
The Crown and Misery campaign takes place in the post-apocalyptic, dystopian science fantasy world of Antares. This super-continent is characterized by rugged landscapes, treacherous terrains, and ethereal beauty, presenting both awe-inspiring wonders and unforgiving challenges. The terrain varies dramatically, featuring towering mountain ranges, harsh and searing deserts, an eternal frozen wasteland, and deep, verdant forests, each beckoning wanderers to unravel their hidden mysteries.

## Antares Exploration
Unfortunately, much of Antares remains unexplored due to the relentless catastrophes plaguing the land. The primary threat comes in the form of swarms of aberrations, which become highly aggressive during nighttime, forcing most of Antares' civilizations to wall themselves inside massive, heavily fortified urban structures called Citadel Cities. However, this strategy is becoming increasingly untenable due to the ever-harsher Warp Storms.

## Bleak World and Glimmers of Hope
Surviving in Antares is fraught with peril. The combination of internal strife, such as wars, rebellions, and civil disobedience, and external threats, including Warp Storms and aberrations, makes life exceedingly bleak. Yet, despite the overwhelming challenges, a glimmer of hope remains among the continent's denizens, driving them to endure and seek out the hidden wonders of their world.
