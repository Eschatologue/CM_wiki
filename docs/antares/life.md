## Biology

Antares is predominantly inhabited by various races, usually humanoids referred to as Ordinaire or Ordinary. This group includes a combination of various humanoids such as Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, and the most common oneâ€”Humans. However, humans hailing from London are categorized differently. Gallian scholars refer to these subgroups of humans as Envahisseurs or "Invaders."

Aside from humanoids, there are god-like beings or dragons known as Aeginae. These majestic creatures used to rule over Antares before mysteriously disappearing thousands of years ago. The few that remain are constantly hunted down by London, for reasons that remains unknown to this day.
