Armour Class (AC) is a measurement of how difficult a creature is to be hit by an attack. In order to successfully hit a creature, the results of an attack roll must have a number equal to or greater than the target's Armour Class. AC can be increased by equipping armour and shields, by selecting certain feats when leveling up, or utilizing certain spells.

## Formula

The default formula that determines AC is:

:   `10 + Dexterity modifier + armour bonus + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- The AC bonus from Dexterity modifier may be capped when wearing medium and is ignored entirely when wearing heavy armour.

- Medium armour caps the Dexterity Modifier to +2, whereas heavy armour ignores the modifier entirely.

- Shields will grant the listed AC bonus to whomever equips it, regardless of which hand they are currently using to wield it.

### Other formulas
Unarmoured creatures may use one of the following different formulas if they have certain features.

- Mage Armour(Spell) or Draconic Resilience(Racial Feature):

:   13 + D`exterity modifier + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- Unarmoured Defence (Barbarian):

:   `10 + Constitution modifier + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- Unarmoured Defence (Monk):

:   `10 + Wisdom modifier + Dexterity modifier + other bonuses and penalties`

## How much AC do I need?

Short Answer? *all of them*. More AC is always better, regardless of your class. 

Long Answer is as follow:  

Armour Class becomes more useful the greater it is - the difference in effectiveness between 20 and 19 AC is greater than the difference in effectiveness between 16 and 15.

To illustrate this, if a defender has 15 AC and 10 HP, and the attacker has +5 (50% chance to hit) to attack rolls, and deals 2 damage per attack, the defender would on average survive for 10 turns.

If the defender's AC was increased to 16 (45% chance to be hit), they would instead survive for an average of 11.1 rounds (an 11% increase in effectiveness).

Meanwhile, if the defender has 19 AC (30% chance to be hit), they would survive for an average of 16.66 rounds. If their AC was increased to 20 (25% chance to be hit), they would be able to survive for an average of 20 rounds (a 20% increase in effectiveness).

The difference between 25 and 24 is even greater, with a 100% increase in effectiveness (50 vs 100 rounds).
