Conditions affect a creature's abilities and can be caused by spells, class features, monster attacks, or other effects. Most conditions, like being blinded, hinder the creature, while a few, like being invisible, provide advantages. 

Conditions either last until they are countered or for a specified duration. If multiple effects impose the same condition, each has its own duration, but the effects do not stack. A creature either has a condition or does not.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

- **Exhaustion**
    
    Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-­term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.

    | :-: | --- |
    | 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |

    | 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
    | 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
    | 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
    | 6 | Death |
    
    If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
    
    A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. 
    
    An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
