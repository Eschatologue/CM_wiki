# Armour

The Armour table lists the game's main armour. The table includes the cost and weight of armour, as well as the following details:

**Category**{ .inl } Every type of Armour falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armour (as shown in the table).

**Armour Class (AC)**{ .inl } The table's Armour Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armour. For example, if you wear Leather Armour, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.

**Strength**{ .inl } If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armour type, that armour reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth**{ .inl } If the table shows “Disadvantage” or a :d20-dis: in the Stealth column for an armour type, the wearer has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

## Armour Training

Anyone can don armour or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armour training. A monster has training with any armour in its stat block.

### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armour

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armour and lack training with it, you have **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

### Shields

You gain the Armour Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it. Moreover, some shields have additional effects when you wield them.

#### Buckler

Buckler is a small shield, gripped in fist, rather than strapped onto the arm. 

When wielding a Buckler, a creature can still use a weapon's **:weapon-prop-versatile: Versatile**{ .em } property.

#### Pavise

A heavy shield, large enough to almost cover the entire body. 

While wielding the Pavise, you can take the **:rsc-a: Utilise**{ .rsc } action to plant the Pavise into the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet, losing the benefit of the shield. Until it is removed (**:rsc-a: Utilise**{ .rsc }), it acts as a Half Cover for creatures behind it.
