# Armour

The Armour table lists the game's main armour. The table includes the cost and weight of armour, as well as the following details:

***Category.*** Every type of armour falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armour (as shown in the table).

***Armour Class (AC).*** The table's Armour Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armour. For example, if you wear Leather Armour, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.

***Strength.*** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armour type, that armour reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

***Stealth.*** If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column for an armour type, the wearer has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

## Armour Training

Anyone can don armour or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armour training. A monster has training with any armour in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armour

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armour and lack training with it, you have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Shield

You gain the Armour Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

***Buckler.*** When wielding a Buckler, you can still use the weapon's :weapon-prop-versatile: ^^Versatile^^ property.
