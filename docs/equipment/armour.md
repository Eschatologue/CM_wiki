# Armour

The Armour table lists the game’s main armour. The table includes the cost and weight of armour, as well as the following details:

#### Category

Every type of armour falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armour (as shown in the table).

#### Armour Class (AC)

The table’s Armour Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armour. For example, if you wear Leather Armour, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.

#### Strength

If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armour type, that armour reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

#### Stealth

If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column for an armour type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

## Armor Training

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character’s class and other features determine the character’s armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.

#### Shield

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.
