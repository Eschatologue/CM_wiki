# Mastery properties

Each weapon has a Mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below witht the following details:

**Type**{ .inl } A Mastery property applies to specific weapon type; either Melee or Ranged weapons.

**Properties**{ .inl } A Mastery property is only eligible to weapons that has specific Weapon properties, or sometimes the weapon itself must have no Properties.

## Homebrew Addition

To give more options for martial classess, the folowing homebrew rules are implemented.

### Changing Mastery properties

This homebrew rule reinstates a mechanic initially introduced in *Unearthed Arcana 2023 Playtest 7*, which allowed classes with the Weapon Mastery feature to change a weapon's Mastery property to another eligible one.

When you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, provided you have Weapon Mastery feature, you can choose any weapon with a Mastery property that you're using and replace its Mastery property with another eligible Mastery property. For example, you could replace the Longsword's [Sap](#sap) property with the [Flex](#flex) property.

**Character Exclusive**{ .inl } These Mastery property changes apply only to the character that makes them and do not affect other characters. For example, if a Barbarian changes a Glaive's Graze property to Cleave, another Barbarian or any other class using the same Glaive would still use its default Graze property.

### More Mastery on One Weapon

This homebrew rule reinstates a mechanic initially introduced in *Unearthed Arcana 2023 Playtest 5*, which allowed Fighters to benefit from multiple Mastery properties for one weapon. Now, its given to every classes that has Weapon Mastery feature.

When you choose weapons for the Weapon Mastery feature, you may instead gain the ability to use more Mastery properties with the same weapon. You choose a weapon you already chose as part of Weapon Mastery and another type of eligible Mastery property. You may now benefit from that Mastery property when you make attacks with this weapon. You must choose which Mastery property applies before making an attack roll and the weapon must satisfy the Mastery property requirement.

For example, a Level 1 Barbarian may instead of using the Mastery property with Greataxe and Handaxe, choose to apply either [Cleave](#cleave) or [Graze](#graze) when making attacks with Greataxe. A Level 1 Rogue may instead of using the Mastery property with Dagger and Shortbow, choose to apply either [Nick](#nick) or [Slow](#slow) with Dagger.
