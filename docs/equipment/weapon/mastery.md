# Mastery properties

Each weapon has a Mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below witht the following details:

<!-- **Type**{.inl} A Mastery property applies to specific weapon type; either Melee or Ranged weapons.

**Properties**{.inl} A Mastery property is only eligible to weapons that has specific Weapon properties, or sometimes the weapon itself must have no Properties. -->

## Homebrew Addition

To give more options for martial classess, the folowing homebrew rules are implemented.

### Replaceable Weapon Mastery  

When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can also **replace the Mastery property** of any weapon you are using with another eligible property. For example, you could change a Longsword's **:wp-mas: Sap**{.wp} property to **:wp-mas: Flex**{.wp}.  

These changes only affect the character who makes them. If a Barbarian replaces a Glaiveâ€™s **:wp-mas: Graze**{.wp} property with **:wp-mas: Cleave**{.wp}, other characters using the same Glaive still use its default **:wp-mas: Graze**{.wp} property.  

### Repeated Weapon Mastery

When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can instead **assign an additional _eligible_ Mastery property** to a weapon you already chose. A weapon can have **no more than six** mastery properties at a time.

If a weapon has multiple mastery properties, you can **only use one of them per attack**. You must choose which mastery property you're using before making the attack. This is true for Mastery properties which effects occurs upon a **hit** (e.g. **:wp-mas: Topple**{.wp}), an **attack** (e.g. **:wp-mas: Nick**{.wp}), or a **miss** (e.g.**:wp-mas: Graze**{.wp}). 

For example, a Level 1 Barbarian could choose to apply either **:wp-mas: Cleave**{.wp} or **:wp-mas: Graze**{.wp} when attacking with a Greataxe, instead of selecting a second weapon for Weapon Mastery. Likewise, a Level 1 Rogue could choose either **:wp-mas: Nick**{.wp} or **:wp-mas: Slow**{.wp} for a Dagger.

    Certain features, such as the [:option-feat-fighting: Two-Weapon Fighting](../../option/feat/feat-fighting-style/phb24.md#two-weapon-fighting) style, apply to this extra attack as if the weapon had the **:wp-prop-light: Light**{.wp} property, allowing you to add your ability modifier to the damage if the feature normally permits it.
