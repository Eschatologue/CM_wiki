# Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

## Changing a Weapon's Mastery Property

This homebrew rule reinstates a mechanic initially introduced in *Unearthed Arcana 2023 Playtest 7*, which allowed classes with the Weapon Mastery feature to change a weapon's Mastery property to another eligible one.

***Changing Mastery Properties.*** When you finish a Long Rest, provided you have Weapon Mastery feature, you can choose any weapon with a Mastery property that you're using and replace its Mastery property with another eligible Mastery property. For example, you could replace the Longsword's [Sap](#sap) property with the [Flex](#flex) property. This follows the rules below:

- ***Character Exclusive.*** These Mastery property changes apply only to the character that makes them and do not affect other characters. For example, if a Barbarian changes a Glaive's Graze property to Cleave, another Barbarian or any other class using the same Glaive would still use its default Graze property.

- ***Defaults on Long Rest.*** Any changes made to a weapon's Mastery property end for the character when they finish a Long Rest.

## PHB'24 Mastery Property
