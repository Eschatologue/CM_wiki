# Weapon Actions

Weapon actions are [actions](../../gameplay/action-options.md) granted to a character based on the weapon they are wielding. Usually, these actions are special attacks that are superior in some way to normal attacks. Each type of weapon has its own set of weapon actions which helps distinguish weapon categories.

### Usage

Each weapon action is limited to **one** use per Short Rest unless otherwise specified. In order to gain access to the weapon actions from a weapon, a creature must be ^^Proficient^^ in that weapon type and have it equipped in the main hand or both hands. Off-hand weapons do not grant weapon actions.

### Saving Throw DC

If a weapon action you use requires your target to make a :d20-save: **Saving Throw** to resist the techniques's effects, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
