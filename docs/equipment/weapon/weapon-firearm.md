# Firearms

*"A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf!"*
{.quote}

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as **'Cordite'** to propel projectiles known as "bullets" over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

## Firearm Proficiency

In *Crown & Misery*, firearms are rare weapons powered by [Cordite](../../lore/glossary.md#cordite), a volatile alchemical compound that becomes inert near creatures attuned to the Weave. This makes firearms largely ineffective for most Antares races—except **Londoners**, who isn't native to Antares, therefore, lack a *natural* connection to the Weave.

Firearms require their own proficiency category (not Simple or Martial) and are unaffected by effects tied to Cold Weapons, such as most enchantments or magical abilities.

Most classes don’t gain Firearm proficiency unless granted by a background, species trait, or similar feature. Though point-and-shoot is easy enough, using a firearm effectively means suppressing your magical nature.

<!-- 
!!! info "Cordite Origins"

    In a spectacular case of "this won't backfire at all," the Elves of Tahdenvalta developed Cordite to counter Londoners during the Great Split. The plan? Create a unstable and deadly substance to those *not* connected to the Weave. The result? Londoners promptly stole the tech, reverse-engineered it, and now they're the only ones who can actually use it properly. Great job, Elves. -->

## Special Rules

Firearms has additional rules as follow:

### Special Rule 1: Lack of proficiency

While operating a firearm is simple enough—point, pull, bang—using it well requires suppressing your innate magical essence, something few can manage. If your character **lacks proficiency with Firearms**, attacking using a Firearms gives you the following effect:

**Half Damage**{.inl} Any damage dealt by Firearms is halved.

**Fouling**{.inl} All attack rolls made with Firearms are made at **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{.d20}, regardless of circumstance.

If your character has proficiency with it, Firearms function as normal. All other rules—such as proficiency and weapon properties—still apply.

### Special Rule 2: No Ability Modifier

You do **not** add your ability modifier to the Firearms's damage roll, unless otherwise stated. 

## Firearm Table

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

**Category**{.inl} Every firearms falls into a category: Short-Arm and Long-Arm. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Short-Arm.  
&emsp;Firearms are considered Ranged weapons for the purposes of effects, abilities, feats, and spells that refer to weapons unless a restriction or limitation explicitly prevents their use. If an ability or spell refers to "ranged weapons" or simply "weapons," firearms are included unless stated otherwise.

**Damage**{.inl} The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage. You do **not** add your ability modifier to the Firearms's damage, unless otherwise stated. 

**Properties**{.inl} Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

**Mastery**{.inl} Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [Mastery Properties](mastery.md) section. To use or replace that property, you must have a feature that lets you do it.
