Firearms are uncommon and challenging to use in Antares, often considered impractical and requiring specific prerequisites, unlike on Earth. Other weapons like bows, crossbows, or arcane staves are easier to use and cheaper, while cold steel weapons are much stronger.

*[cold steel]: Melee weapons, usually swords, warhammers, or axes.

Gun weapons, shortened as guns and officially referred to as firearms, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as "cordite" to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

London, as the inventor of firearms, maintains tight control over their invention and production to prevent technology leakage and misuse. This tight control contributes to the exorbitant cost and difficulty of obtaining firearms, even through legitimate means. Furthermore, procuring the expensive and rare bullets adds to the impracticality of these weapons.

However, British citizens with the proper permits can access firearms and ammunition either within London or at British Embassies located throughout Antares.

### Firearms Categories

Firearms in Antares are divided into three categories: short-arm, long-arm, and heavy firearms. Each category serves a unique purpose and offers distinct advantages in combat. Note that this section is non-exhaustive and represents common examples within each category.

#### Short-Arm
Short-arm firearms include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

- **Pistols:** Compact and easy to handle, pistols are perfect for quick-draw situations and can be fired with one hand.
- **Revolvers:** Known for their reliability and stopping power, revolvers are a popular choice among those who value durability over capacity.

#### Long-Arm
Long-arm firearms encompass rifles, submachine guns (SMGs), and other longer-range weapons. These are designed for mid to long-range engagements, offering greater accuracy and firepower compared to short-arms.

- **Rifles:** Highly accurate and powerful, rifles are the preferred choice for long-range combat. They come in various types, including bolt-action and semi-automatic.
- **Submachine Guns (SMGs):** SMGs provide a high rate of fire and are effective in close to mid-range combat, making them versatile for different combat scenarios.
- **Shotguns:** Shotguns are powerful weapons effective at close to mid-range. They fire a spread of pellets, making them ideal for hitting a single target with devastating force.

#### Heavy Firearms
Heavy firearms include rocket launchers, flamethrowers, machine guns, and other large, destructive weapons. These are typically used for specialized situations where maximum firepower is needed.

- **Rocket Launchers:** Capable of dealing massive damage, rocket launchers are used to destroy fortified positions or vehicles.
- **Flamethrowers:** Ideal for clearing out entrenched enemies, flamethrowers spread fire over a wide area, causing continuous damage.
- **Machine Guns:** Offering a high rate of sustained fire, machine guns are used to suppress enemy forces and provide heavy support during engagements.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with *special* properties are listed here:

#### Shotgun, Over-under

When you make an automatic attack with this weapon, the subsequent attack roll doesn’t suffer disadvantage.

### Grenade Launcher

This weapon uses grenades as its ammunitions. When you attack, you can target an unoccupied space within its range. Whenever you hit the target or not, the grenade loaded in this weapon will land or explode as if it were thrown to that point.

## Grenades

As an Action, a grenade of any type can be thrown at a point you can see within 60-feet, which it will then explode and affect an area centered on the point. Grenade can also be launched using a Grenade Launcher, in which the range follows of what stated in the grenade launcher. 

What effect each type of grenade can cause is stated on [Grenade Effects](#grenade-effects).
