# Firearms

*"A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf!"*
{ .quote }

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles known as "bullets" over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londiniers and are used exclusively by their people.

## Firearm Proficiency

In *Crown & Misery*, firearms are rare weapons powered by **Cordite**, a volatile alchemical compound that becomes inert near creatures attuned to the Weave. This makes firearms largely ineffective for most Antares races—except **Londiniers**, who lack a natural connection to the Weave.

Firearms require their own proficiency category (not Simple or Martial) and are unaffected by effects tied to Cold Weapons, such as most enchantments or magical abilities.

Most classes don’t gain Firearm proficiency unless granted by a background, species trait, or similar feature. Though point-and-shoot is easy enough, using a firearm effectively means suppressing your magical nature—an awkward task for spellcasters.

!!! info "Cordite Origins"

    In a spectacular case of "this won't backfire at all," the Elves of Tahdenvalta developed Cordite to counter Londiniers during their war with Albion. The plan? Create a weapon deadly to those *not* connected to the Weave. The result? Londiniers promptly stole the tech, reverse-engineered it, and now they're the only ones who can actually use it properly. Great job, Elves.

### Special Rule: Spellcasters and Firearms

While operating a firearm is simple enough—point, pull, bang—using it well requires suppressing your magical essence, something few can manage. If your character **has any spell slots**—even one—attacking using a Firearms gives you the following effect:

**Half Damage**{.inl} Any damage dealt by Firearms is halved.

**Fouling**{.inl} All attack rolls made with Firearms are made at Disadvantage, regardless of circumstance.

To bypass these penalties, specially modified Cordite rounds can be purchased from underground or illegal gunsmiths. These cost 3x as much as standard ammunition but remove both effects for spellcasters. 

If your character has no remaining spell slots, Firearms function as normal. All other rules—such as proficiency and weapon properties—still apply.

## Firearm Table

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

**Category**{.inl} Every weapon falls into a category: Short-Arm and Long-Arm. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.  
&emsp;Firearms are considered Ranged weapons for the purposes of effects, abilities, feats, and spells that refer to weapons unless a restriction or limitation explicitly prevents their use. If an ability or spell refers to "ranged weapons" or simply "weapons," firearms are included unless stated otherwise.

**Damage**{.inl} The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage. You do **not** add your ability modifier to the Firearms's damage, unless otherwise stated. 

**Properties**{.inl} Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

**Mastery**{.inl} Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [Mastery Properties](mastery.md) section. To use or replace that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Short-Arm

The Short-Arm Table include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.
