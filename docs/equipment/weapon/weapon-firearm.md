> "A good blade’s worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun’s only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that’s as strong as the arm that swings it—and there’s no arm stronger than a dwarf’s!" – *A Dwarven Blacksmith*

# Firearms

Firearms are uncommon and challenging to use in Antares, often considered impractical and requiring specific prerequisites. Other weapons like bows, crossbows, or arcane staves are easier to use and cheaper, while cold steel weapons are much stronger.

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

London, as the inventor of firearms, maintains tight control over their invention and production to prevent technology leakage and misuse. This tight control contributes to the exorbitant cost and difficulty of obtaining firearms, even through legitimate means. Furthermore, procuring the expensive and rare bullets adds to the impracticality of these weapons. However, British citizens with the proper permits can access firearms and ammunition either within London or at British Embassies located throughout Antares.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with *special* properties are listed here:

#### Grenade Launcher

This weapon uses grenades as its ammunitions. When you attack, you can target an unoccupied space within its range. Whenever you hit the target or not, the grenade loaded in this weapon will land or explode as if it were thrown to that point.

## Firearm Proficiency

In Antares, firearms are known but not commonly used. Many find them impractical compared to magic or cold weapons like swords, hammers, or bows, which are generally stronger in the hands of skilled users. Consequently, proficiency in firearms is not automatic, even for those experienced with other weapons.

To wield firearms effectively, characters must undergo specialized training. Even creatures proficient with martial weapons need to train to use firearms.

### Basic Understanding

Most creatures are aware of how firearms work, but using them effectively requires specific knowledge. When attempting to use a firearm for the first time, a creature must make a **DC 15 Intelligence check** to figure out how the weapon functions. The creature's existing weapon proficiencies can provide an :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check:

- **Short-Arms:** Creatures proficient with **Light Crossbows, Repeating Light Crossbows, Shortbows, Hand Crossbows** or **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with short-arms (e.g., pistols, handguns).
- **Long-Arms:** Creatures proficient with **Arbalests, Longbows, Heavy Crossbows, Repeating Heavy Crossbows** or **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with long-arms (e.g., rifles, shotguns).
- **Advanced Firearms:** Creatures proficient with **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with Advanced Firearms (e.g., rocket launchers, flamethrowers).

#### Training and Proficiency

Once a creature successfully understands how a firearm operates, they can spend downtime training with it to gain proficiency. Only after this training can they use the weapon effectively without further checks. This training follows the rules written in [Downtime Activity: Training](../../gameplay/downtime/training.md).

## Weapon Descriptions

Firearms in Antares are divided into three categories: **Short-Arm**, **Long-Arm**, and **Advanced Firearms**. Each category serves a unique purpose and offers distinct advantages in combat. Note that this section is non-exhaustive and represents common examples within each category.

#### Short-Arm

Short-arm firearms include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

- **Pistols:** Compact and easy to handle, pistols are perfect for quick-draw situations and can be fired with one hand.
- **Revolvers:** Known for their reliability and stopping power, revolvers are a popular choice among those who value durability over capacity.
- **Submachine Guns (SMGs):** SMGs provide a high rate of fire and are effective in close to mid-range combat, making them versatile for different combat scenarios.

#### Long-Arm

Long-arm firearms encompass rifles, submachine guns (SMGs), and other longer-range weapons. These are designed for mid to long-range engagements, offering greater accuracy and firepower compared to short-arms.

- **Rifles:** Highly accurate and powerful, rifles are the preferred choice for long-range combat. They come in various types, including bolt-action and semi-automatic.
- **Shotguns:** Shotguns are powerful weapons effective at close to mid-range. They fire a spread of pellets, making them ideal for hitting a single target with devastating force.

#### Advanced Firearms

Advanced firearms include rocket launchers, flamethrowers, machine guns, and other large, destructive weapons. These are typically used for specialized situations where maximum firepower is needed.

- **Rocket Launchers:** Capable of dealing massive damage, rocket launchers are used to destroy fortified positions or vehicles.
- **Flamethrowers:** Ideal for clearing out entrenched enemies, flamethrowers spread fire over a wide area, causing continuous damage.
- **Machine Guns:** Offering a high rate of sustained fire, machine guns are used to suppress enemy forces and provide heavy support during engagements.
