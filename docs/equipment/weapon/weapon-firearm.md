# Firearms

> "A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf's!" - *A Dwarven Blacksmith*

Firearms are uncommon and challenging to use in Antares, often considered impractical and requiring specific prerequisites and maintenance. Other weapons like bows, crossbows, or arcane staves are easier to use and cheaper, while melee weapons are much stronger.

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

## Firearm Table

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

***Category.*** Every weapon falls into a category: Short-Arm, Long-Arm, Advanced. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.

***Damage.*** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

***Properties.*** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

***Category.*** Firearms are considered ranged weapons for the purposes of effects, abilities, feats, and spells that refer to weapons unless a restriction or limitation explicitly prevents their use. If an ability or spell refers to “ranged weapons” or simply “weapons,” firearms are included unless stated otherwise.

### Short-Arm

The Short-Arm Table include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

## Firearm Proficiency

In Antares, arcane staves are common, while firearms are rare due to their reliance on *Cordite*, a substance rendered inert near creatures attuned to the Weave. This includes all Antares races except Londoners. 

Using firearms requires suppressing one’s connection to the Weave, a difficult skill that few pursue, as traditional ranged weapons like bows are more practical for most.

### Basic Understanding

Most creatures are aware of how firearms work, but using them effectively requires specific knowledge. When attempting to use a firearm for the first time, a creature must make a **DC 15 Intelligence check** to figure out how the weapon functions. The creature's existing weapon proficiencies can provide an :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check:

- **Short-Arms:** Creatures proficient with *Light Crossbows*, *Repeating Light Crossbows*, *Shortbows*, *Hand Crossbows* or *Martial Weapons* have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with Short-Arms.
- **Long-Arms:** Creatures proficient with *Arbalests*, *Longbows*, *Heavy Crossbows*, *Repeating Heavy Crossbows* or *Martial Weapons* have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with Long-Arms.
- **Advanced Firearms:** Creatures proficient with **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with Advanced Firearms (e.g., rocket launchers, flamethrowers).

#### Training and Proficiency

Once a creature successfully understands how a firearm operates, they can spend downtime training with it to gain proficiency. Only after this training can they use the weapon effectively without further checks. This training follows the rules written in [Downtime Activity: Training](../../gameplay/downtime/training.md).
