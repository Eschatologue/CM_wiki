# Firearms

> "A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf's!" – *A Dwarven Blacksmith*

Firearms are uncommon and challenging to use in Antares, often considered impractical and requiring specific prerequisites and maintenance. Other weapons like bows, crossbows, or arcane staves are easier to use and cheaper, while cold steel weapons are much stronger.

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game’s main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

***Category.*** Every weapon falls into a category: Short-Arm, Long-Arm, Advanced. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.

***Damage.*** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

***Properties.*** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

***Augment Slot (A. Slot).*** Each firearms has a number of Augmentation Slots, which is defined further in [Firearms Augmentation](#augmentation). A Firearm can only bear a number of Augmentations up to this number.

### Short-Arm

The Short-Arm Table include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with *special* properties are listed here:

#### Grenade Launcher

This weapon uses grenades as its ammunitions. When you attack, you can target an unoccupied space within its range. Whenever you hit the target or not, the grenade loaded in this weapon will land or explode as if it were thrown to that point.

## Firearm Proficiency

In Antares, firearms are known but not commonly used. Many find them impractical compared to magic or cold weapons like swords, hammers, or bows, which are generally stronger in the hands of skilled users. Consequently, proficiency in firearms is not automatic, even for those experienced with other weapons.

To wield firearms effectively, characters must undergo specialized training. Even creatures proficient with martial weapons need to train to use firearms.

### Basic Understanding

Most creatures are aware of how firearms work, but using them effectively requires specific knowledge. When attempting to use a firearm for the first time, a creature must make a **DC 15 Intelligence check** to figure out how the weapon functions. The creature's existing weapon proficiencies can provide an :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check:

- **Short-Arms:** Creatures proficient with **Light Crossbows, Repeating Light Crossbows, Shortbows, Hand Crossbows** or **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with short-arms (e.g., pistols, handguns).
- **Long-Arms:** Creatures proficient with **Arbalests, Longbows, Heavy Crossbows, Repeating Heavy Crossbows** or **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with long-arms (e.g., rifles, shotguns).
- **Advanced Firearms:** Creatures proficient with **Martial Weapons** have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on this check with Advanced Firearms (e.g., rocket launchers, flamethrowers).

#### Training and Proficiency

Once a creature successfully understands how a firearm operates, they can spend downtime training with it to gain proficiency. Only after this training can they use the weapon effectively without further checks. This training follows the rules written in [Downtime Activity: Training](../../gameplay/downtime/training.md).

## Augmentation

With the release of the 2024 edition of the Player's Handbook, all Cold Weapons gained new mechanics known as [Weapon Mastery](index.md#mastery-properties), allowing them to produce additional effects upon hitting a target. This mechanic reflects the wielder's mastery and skill in wielding such weapons. However, as noted earlier, the power of firearms comes from the weapon itself, not the strength or skill of the user. A user can be as strong as they wish, but they are ultimately limited by the weapon's inherent capabilities.

To balance this, those who choose to wield firearms can now access a new mechanic called "Augmentations." These allow users to modify their weapons with various attachments, enabling them to personalise and enhance their firearms according to their preferences.

### Mechanics

As the name suggest, firearms augmentations are only eligible to firearms that met the prerequisites. To make an augmentation to a firearms you few things:

***Tools.*** You need to have a Gunsmith's Tool to make modification with your Firearms.

***Proficiency.*** You need to be Proficient at a Firearms you want to Augment, you also need to have and proficient with Gunsmith's Tool.

***Time.*** Augmenting a firearm takes time and can be usually be done as part of a Long Rest or you dedicate your time to Augment said firearm during a Short Rest.

***Money.*** Adding a new augmentation to a firearm costs money, this cost represents the materials you need to acquire to make said augmentations to that one specific firearms types, once you make that augmentation, you always has it on you and don't need to expend additional money to make a new one.
