# Firearms

*"A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf!"*
{ .quote }

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles known as "bullets" over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

## Firearm Table

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

**Category**{ .inl } Every weapon falls into a category: Short-Arm and Long-Arm. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.  
&emsp;Firearms are considered Ranged weapons for the purposes of effects, abilities, feats, and spells that refer to weapons unless a restriction or limitation explicitly prevents their use. If an ability or spell refers to "ranged weapons" or simply "weapons," firearms are included unless stated otherwise.

**Damage**{ .inl } The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

**Properties**{ .inl } Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

**Mastery**{ .inl } Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [Mastery Properties](mastery.md) section. To use or replace that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Short-Arm

The Short-Arm Table include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

##### Short-Arm

## Firearm Proficiency

In the *Crown & Misery* setting, firearms are rare weapons powered by *Cordite*, a volatile substance rendered inert near creatures attuned to the Weave. This unique interaction makes firearms largely ineffective for most Antares races, except **Londoners**, who are not inherently tied to the Weave. 

Firearms require a special proficiency distinct from :prof-wp-simple: Simple or :prof-wp-martial: Martial weapons. They are unaffected by mechanics that apply to Cold Weapons, such as certain enchantments or abilities. 

Most classes lack Firearm proficiency unless specifically granted by a background, species feature, or other traits. While the basic operation of firearms—*pull the trigger, it fires*—is widely understood, wielding them effectively requires suppressing one’s connection to the Weave, making them particularly challenging for magic users. Non-magical individuals are more adept at mastering these weapons.

### Lack of Proficiency

If a character isn’t proficient with firearms, their ability to use them is hindered by their magical connection to the Weave. This restriction affects mechanics associated with firearms with the following rules below. These rules is obviously ignored whenever a character gain Proficiency with Firearms.

***Attack Rolls***{ .inl } When making an attack roll with a Firearm without proficiency, the roll is reduced by twice a number equal to the highest spell slot level the character can expend or use. For example, a Wizard who can use a level 5 spell slot at its respective level will have -10 to their attack roll using Firearms. If the Wizard gain a level which allows it to use a level 6 spell slots, this penalty increases to -12.

***Mastery***{ .inl } Creature that lacks proficiency with Firearms can't use its Mastery property, regardless if it has a class feature that allows it.
