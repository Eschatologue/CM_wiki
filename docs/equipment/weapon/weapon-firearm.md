> *"A good blade’s worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun’s only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that’s as strong as the arm that swings it—and there’s no arm stronger than a dwarf’s!"* – A Dwarven Blacksmith

# Firearms

Firearms are uncommon and challenging to use in Antares, often considered impractical and requiring specific prerequisites, unlike on Earth. Other weapons like bows, crossbows, or arcane staves are easier to use and cheaper, while cold steel weapons are much stronger.

Gun weapons, shortened as guns and often referred to as firearms, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

London, as the inventor of firearms, maintains tight control over their invention and production to prevent technology leakage and misuse. This tight control contributes to the exorbitant cost and difficulty of obtaining firearms, even through legitimate means. Furthermore, procuring the expensive and rare bullets adds to the impracticality of these weapons.

However, British citizens with the proper permits can access firearms and ammunition either within London or at British Embassies located throughout Antares.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with *special* properties are listed here:

***Grenade Launcher.*** This weapon uses grenades as its ammunitions. When you attack, you can target an unoccupied space within its range. Whenever you hit the target or not, the grenade loaded in this weapon will land or explode as if it were thrown to that point.

## Firearm Proficiency

In Antares, firearms are known but not commonly used, many find them impractical compared to magic or cold weapons like swords, hammers, or bows, which are generally stronger in the hands of skilled users. Consequently, proficiency in firearms is not automatic, even for those experienced with other weapons.

#### Basic Understanding

Most creatures are aware of how firearms work, but using them effectively requires specific knowledge. Any creature attempting to use a firearm must make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a success, the creature figures out the basic function of the weapon. If a creature has proficiency in martial weapons, it makes this Intelligence check with :d20-adv: Advantage. However, the creature is not considered Proficient with firearms until it spends downtime [training](#training-and-proficiency) with the weapon.

#### Training and Proficiency

Once a creature successfully [understands](#basic-understanding) how a firearm operates, they can spend downtime training with it to gain proficiency. Only after this training can they use the weapon effectively without further checks.

## Weapon Descriptions

Firearms in Antares are divided into three categories: short-arm, long-arm, and heavy firearms. Each category serves a unique purpose and offers distinct advantages in combat. Note that this section is non-exhaustive and represents common examples within each category.

#### Short-Arm

Short-arm firearms include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

- **Pistols:** Compact and easy to handle, pistols are perfect for quick-draw situations and can be fired with one hand.
- **Revolvers:** Known for their reliability and stopping power, revolvers are a popular choice among those who value durability over capacity.

#### Long-Arm

Long-arm firearms encompass rifles, submachine guns (SMGs), and other longer-range weapons. These are designed for mid to long-range engagements, offering greater accuracy and firepower compared to short-arms.

- **Rifles:** Highly accurate and powerful, rifles are the preferred choice for long-range combat. They come in various types, including bolt-action and semi-automatic.
- **Submachine Guns (SMGs):** SMGs provide a high rate of fire and are effective in close to mid-range combat, making them versatile for different combat scenarios.
- **Shotguns:** Shotguns are powerful weapons effective at close to mid-range. They fire a spread of pellets, making them ideal for hitting a single target with devastating force.

#### Advanced Firearms

Advanced firearms include rocket launchers, flamethrowers, machine guns, and other large, destructive weapons. These are typically used for specialized situations where maximum firepower is needed.

- **Rocket Launchers:** Capable of dealing massive damage, rocket launchers are used to destroy fortified positions or vehicles.
- **Flamethrowers:** Ideal for clearing out entrenched enemies, flamethrowers spread fire over a wide area, causing continuous damage.
- **Machine Guns:** Offering a high rate of sustained fire, machine guns are used to suppress enemy forces and provide heavy support during engagements.

## Grenades

As an Action, a grenade of any type can be thrown at a point you can see within 60-feet, which it will then explode and affect an area centered on the point. Grenade can also be launched using a Grenade Launcher, in which the range follows of what stated in the grenade launcher. 

What effect each type of grenade can cause is stated on [Grenade Effects](#grenade-effects).
