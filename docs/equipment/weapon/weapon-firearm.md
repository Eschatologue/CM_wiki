# Firearms

**Gun weapons**, shortened as **guns** and often referred to as **firearms**, are unique mid-range to long-range weapons that use a special explosive charge known as '**cordite**' to propel projectiles over long distances. These weapons were brought over by the Londoners and are used exclusively by their people.

###### *"A good blade's worth more than any fire-spitter. A gun's only as strong as its powder and steel, but a sword or an axe? Aye, that's as strong as the arm that swings it—and there's no arm stronger than a dwarf's!"* <br><p align="right"> – A Dwarven Blacksmith </p>

## Firearm Table

The Firearm tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

***Category.*** Every weapon falls into a category: Short-Arm, Long-Arm, Advanced. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.

***Damage.*** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

***Properties.*** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

***Category.*** Firearms are considered Ranged weapons for the purposes of effects, abilities, feats, and spells that refer to weapons unless a restriction or limitation explicitly prevents their use. If an ability or spell refers to "ranged weapons" or simply "weapons," firearms are included unless stated otherwise.

***Mastery.*** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [Mastery Properties](mastery.md) section. To use or replace that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Short-Arm

The Short-Arm Table include pistols, revolvers, and other small, easily concealable weapons. These are ideal for close-quarters combat and provide a good balance between firepower and maneuverability.

## Firearm Proficiency

In Antares, firearms are rare, relying on *Cordite*, a substance rendered inert near creatures attuned to the Weave—a trait of all Antares races except **Londoners**. Using firearms requires suppressing one's connection to the Weave, a skill few pursue as traditional ranged weapons are more practical.

Firearms require a unique proficiency distinct from :prof-wp-simple: Simple or :prof-wp-martial: Martial weapons. Most classes lack this Proficiency unless granted by a specific background, racial feature, or similar trait. They are also excluded from mechanics involving Cold weapons. 

While most creatures understand the basic operation of firearms—*pull the trigger, it fires*—those attuned to the Weave, especially spellcasters users, struggle to wield them effectively. Non-magical individuals are better suited to mastering these weapons.

### Using Firearms

When a character without Firearm proficiency attempts to make an attack using Firearms, a penalty applies. This penalty reflects their reliance on magic and is determined by their spellcaster type:

:material-circle-slice-8: ***Full Casters*** (e.g., Wizard, Druid, Cleric, Sorcerer)  
Characters with spell slots up to level 9 suffer a penalty equal to their class level. For example, A level 12 Wizard attempting the check has a -12 penalty, making it exceptionally difficult to succeed.  

:material-circle-slice-4: ***Half Casters*** (e.g., Artificer, Magus, Paladin, Ranger)  
Characters with spell slots up to level 5 suffer a penalty equal to half their class level (rounded up). For example, A level 10 Paladin would have a -5 penalty (10 × 1/2 = 5).  

:material-circle-slice-3: ***One-Third Casters*** (e.g., Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Fighter (Eldritch Knight))  
Characters with spell slots up to level 4 suffer a penalty equal to 1/3 of their class level (rounded up). For example, A level 9 Arcane Trickster would have a -3 penalty (9 × 1/3 = 3).  

:material-circle-outline: ***Warlocks*** & ***Non-Casters*** (e.g., Fighter, Barbarian, Rogue)  
These classes face no penalty when using Firearms with no proficiency.
