# Cold Weapon

[Cold Weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_weapon) encompasses all non-firearm melee and ranged weapons. They are the most common types of weapons you can find while adventuring, whether they are sold, given, wielded, or issued to most adventurers or armies within Antares. You can expect weapons from this category to be available at most shops or with merchants you come across during your adventure.

The Weapons tables in this section shows the game's main weapons. These table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

**Category**{ .inl } Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.

**Melee or Ranged**{ .inl } A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.

**Damage**{ .inl } The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

**Properties**{ .inl } Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [Properties](index.md#weapon-properties) section.

**Mastery**{ .inl } Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [Mastery Properties](mastery.md) section. To use or replace that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.
