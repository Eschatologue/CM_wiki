[Cold weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_weapon) encompasses all non-firearm melee and ranged weapons. They are the most common types of weapons you can find while adventuring, whether they are sold, given, wielded, or issued to most adventurers or armies within Antares.

You can expect weapons from this category to be available at most shops or with merchants you come across during your adventure.

## Cold Weapon Table

Weapons in D&D are categorized into simple and martial weapons, each serving different roles and offering distinct advantages in combat. 

### Simple Weapons

Simple weapons are easy to use and require minimal training, making them accessible to most characters. They are commonly found and typically less expensive than martial weapons.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

#### Net

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. 

A creature can use its :rsc-action: **Action** to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing a total of 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an :rsc-action: **Action**, :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**, or :material-star-four-points: **Reaction** to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Lance

You have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

## New and Modified Weapons

This D&D campaign introduces new weapons and modifies existing ones. New weapons are introduced to provide more options and selection to players, while some existing weapons are given new properties to encourage their use.

### Modified Weapon

You can refer to the [Weapon Table](weapon-cold.md#cold-weapon-table) to see which existing weapon gained a new property.

### New Weapons

#### Falchion
*Simple Melee Weapon, 100 sp*

Historically a "commoner" weapon, the falchion was allegedly lower in cost and is theorized to have had more utilitarian purposes outside of war. However, in this D&D campaign, the falchion has been added to provide more options for simple weapons. It is comparable to quarterstaves but lacks the *reach* property, which is replaced with *finesse* instead.

#### War Scythe
*Simple Melee Weapon, 50 sp*

The war scythe, originally a farming implement, has been converted into a weapon of war because peasants often couldn't afford more traditional weapons. It is comparable to a spear but can only be used with two hands.

#### Blowgun
*Simple Ranged Weapon, 100 sp*

The blowgun has been moved from the Martial Weapon category to the Simple Weapon category. It doesn't make sense for a blowgun to be classified as a Martial Weapon. Even if it did, moving it to the Simple Weapon category provides more selection for that category.

#### Estoc
*Martial Melee Weapon, 300 sp*

The estoc is introduced as a versatile finesse weapon to provide a comparable alternative to longswords. Some might argue that giving a finesse weapon a 1d10 damage die is a bad idea, but a 1.5 damage difference is negligible. To balance this, it costs twice as much as a longsword.

#### Sabre
*Martial Melee Weapon, 150 sp*

The sabre is a slashing damage type option for finesse weapons-like the rapier. Its price is halved due to the existence of the *piercer* feat.

#### Arbalest
*Martial Ranged Weapon, 950 sp*

The arbalest is a new and expensive martial ranged weapon designed to incorporate the new properties added by firearms. The concept of a very heavy crossbow is quite appealing.

#### Crossbow, Repeating
*Martial Ranged Weapon, 850 sp*

This simple crossbow, but classified as a martial weapon, has automatic and reload properties. If you don't want to take the Crossbow Expert feat, use this weapon.

#### Compound Bow
*Martial Ranged Weapon, 850 sp*

The compound bow is a more powerful version of the longbow. It has less range and is more expensive, but it deals a 1d10 damage die.
