[Cold weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_weapon) encompasses all non-firearm melee and ranged weapons. They are the most common types of weapons you can find while adventuring, whether they are sold, given, wielded, or issued to most adventurers or armies within Antares.

You can expect weapons from this category to be available at most shops or with merchants you come across during your adventure.

## Cold Weapon Table

Weapons in D&D are categorized into simple and martial weapons, each serving different roles and offering distinct advantages in combat. 

### Simple Weapons

### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

#### Net

A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. 

A creature can use its :rsc-action: **Action** to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its Reach on a success. Dealing a total of 5 :dmg-slashing: Slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an :rsc-action: **Action**, :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**, or :material-star-four-points: **Reaction** to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Lance

You have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.
