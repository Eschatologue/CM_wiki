# Weapons

Your class grants Proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

## Weapon Proficiencies

Your race, class, and feats can grant you Proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack Proficiency, you do not add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Categories

### Cold Weapons

A Cold Weapon is a weapon that does not involve fire or explosions resulting from the use of gunpowder or other explosive materials. These are the most common weapons found in this setting, and they are most useful to the average inhabitants of Antares.

Cold Weapons can be categorized into two as per standard D&D: **Simple Weapons** and **Martial Weapons**.

### Firearms

Firearms are weapons that use an explosive charge to propel projectiles called "bullets" at incredible speed. These new types of weaponry were brought over by the Londoners when they first arrived in Antares, making them more adept at using firearms due to their long experience with them. 

Firearms are very rare, and rarely sold outside of Albion-controlled territories. Even if you find one, it is almost impractical compared to other weapons due to their reliance on [Cordites](../../lore/glossary.md#cordite).

:wp-prop-ammunition:{ .x3l }

:   ### Ammunition { .noborder }

    You can use a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-ammunition: Ammunition**{.wp} property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). 

    At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. Firearms can't benefit from this.
