# Weapons

Your class grants Proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

## Weapon Proficiencies

Your race, class, and feats can grant you Proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack Proficiency, you do not add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll.

### Weapon Save DC

When a weapon requires its target to make a saving throw—whether through its Property, Mastery property, or other effects—the DC is as follow:

**Weapon Save DC:** 8 + Ability Modifier used in the attack + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)
{ .align-center }

## Weapon Categories

### Cold Weapons

A Cold Weapon is a weapon that does not involve fire or explosions resulting from the use of gunpowder or other explosive materials. These are the most common weapons found in this setting, and they are most useful to the average inhabitants of Antares.

Cold Weapons can be categorized into two as per standard D&D: **Simple Weapons** and **Martial Weapons**.

### Firearms

Firearms are weapons that use an explosive charge to propel projectiles called "bullets" at incredible speed. These new types of weaponry were brought over by the Londoners when they first arrived in Antares, making them more adept at using firearms due to their long experience with them. 

Firearms are very rare, and rarely sold outside of Albion-controlled territories. Even if you find one, it is almost impractical compared to other weapons due to their reliance on [Cordites](../../lore/glossary.md#cordite).

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

### :weapon-prop-ammunition: Ammunition { .noborder }

You can use a weapon that has the **:weapon-prop-ammunition: Ammunition** property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). 

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. Firearms and weapon with **[:weapon-prop-explosive: Explosive](#explosive)**{ .nowrap } property can't benefit from this.

### :weapon-prop-automatic: Automatic { .noborder }

Each time you make an attack with an **:weapon-prop-automatic: Automatic** weapon, you can make one extra attack later on the same turn. This extra attack must be made with the *same weapon* provided it has enough Ammunition for the attack, and you don't add your ability modifier to the additional attack's damage roll, unless that modifier is negative. 

If the Automatic property includes a plus and a number (e.g., Automatic (+3)), that number determines the maximum additional attacks you can make each time you attack with the weapon. For example, a Sub-Machine Gun with Automatic (+3) allows up to 3 extra attacks per attack.

The creature takes the weapon's damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Your initial target makes this **:d20-save: Saving Throw** at a **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 }.
