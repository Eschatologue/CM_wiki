# Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

## Weapon Proficiencies

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the :d20-attack:**Attack Roll** for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an :d20-attack:**Attack Roll** using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the :d20-attack:**Attack Roll**.

## Weapon Categories

### Cold Weaponry

Main article: [Cold Weapons](weapon-cold.md)

A cold weapon is a weapon that does not involve fire or explosions resulting from the use of gunpowder or other explosive materials. These are the most common weapons found in this setting, and they are most useful to the average inhabitants of Antares.

Cold weapons can be categorized into two types as per base D&D: Simple Weapons and Martial Weapons

- **Simple Weapnos**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency, often found in the hands of commoners.
- **Martial Weapons**. Requires more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

### Firearms

Main article: [Firearms](weapon-firearm.md) 

Firearms are weapons that use an explosive charge to propel projectiles called "bullets" at incredible speed. These new types of weaponry were brought over by the Londoners when they first arrived in Antares, making them more adept at using firearms due to their long experience with them. Firearms are very rare, and you will rarely see one outside of London-controlled territories. Even if you do, they won't sell it to you unless you are a London citizen.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.


### :weapon-prop-ammunition:{ .lg .pad-r } Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

### :weapon-prop-automatic:{ .lg .pad-r } Automatic

When you take the :d20-attack:**Attack** Action on your turn and attack with an Automatic weapon, you can make extra attacks up to the number in the parenthesis later on the same turn, within the same round. Those extra attacks are always made with :d20-disadv:**Disadvantage** regardless of circumstances and expends ammunitions equal to the number of attacks.

### :weapon-prop-explosive:{ .lg .pad-r } Explosive

When this weapon’s projectile hits a target, it explodes in a diameter sphere on the parenthesis. The weapon can target a point within its range. Each creature in the area of effect centered on the point or the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Targets takes the weapon's damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Your initial target makes this saving throw at a :d20-disadv:**Disadvantage**.

### :weapon-prop-finesse:{ .lg .pad-r } Finesse

When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

### :weapon-prop-heavy:{ .lg .pad-r } Heavy

Heavy weapon is unwieldy compared to other weapons. You have :d20-disadv:**Disadvantage** on your :d20-attack:**Attack Roll**s with a Heavy weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn’t at least 13, and if it’s a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.

### :weapon-prop-light:{ .lg .pad-r } Light

When you take the :d20-attack:**Attack** Action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a :rsc-bonus-action:**Bonus Action** later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modifier to the extra attack’s damage, unless that modifier is negative.

### :weapon-prop-loading:{ .lg .pad-r } Loading

Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, :rsc-bonus-action:**Bonus Action**, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

### :weapon-prop-mounted:{ .lg .pad-r } Mounted

This weapon is normally used while attached to a tripod, vehicle, or other bracing mount. You can mount or unmount this weapon as an action. While it is mounted, it can’t be moved. It can only be used to make an attack while unmounted if held by a creature with a Strength score of at least 15.

### :weapon-prop-ranged:{ .lg .pad-r } Ranged

This weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have :d20-disadv:**Disadvantage** on the :d20-attack:**Attack Roll**. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

### :weapon-prop-reach:{ .lg .pad-r } Reach

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.

### :weapon-prop-reload:{ .lg .pad-r } Reload

This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes a :rsc-bonus-action:**Bonus Action**; otherwise, reloading it takes an :rsc-action:**Action**. Some weapons require an :rsc-action:**Action** or longer to reload, even if you have proficiency, which is specified in the Reload property. If reloading a weapon requires longer than one action, the weapon can't be used to make attacks until reloading is finished.

### :weapon-prop-scatter:{ .lg .pad-r } Scatter

### :weapon-prop-two-handed:{ .lg .pad-r } Two-Handed
