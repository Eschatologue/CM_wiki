# Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

## Weapon Proficiencies

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Categories

### Cold Weaponry

Main article: [Cold Weapons](weapon-cold.md)

A cold weapon is a weapon that does not involve fire or explosions resulting from the use of gunpowder or other explosive materials. These are the most common weapons found in this setting, and they are most useful to the average inhabitants of Antares.

Cold weapons can be categorized into two types as per base D&D: Simple Weapons and Martial Weapons

- **Simple Weapnos**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency, often found in the hands of commoners.

- **Martial Weapons**. Requires more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

### Firearms

Main article: [Firearms](weapon-firearm.md) 

Firearms are weapons that use an explosive charge to propel projectiles called "bullets" at incredible speed. These new types of weaponry were brought over by the Londoners when they first arrived in Antares, making them more adept at using firearms due to their long experience with them. Firearms are very rare, and you will rarely see one outside of London-controlled territories. Even if you do, they won't sell it to you unless you are a London citizen.
