# Grenades

Grenades are handheld explosive devices introduced to Antares by the Londoners. While the concept of delivering explosives in a throwable form isn't entirely new—often achieved through slinging spells or using crude, rudimentary versions—the Londoners have perfected and standardised these weapons. Their grenades offer a precise and reliable way to unleash destructive power, making them a valuable, though expensive, tool on the battlefield.

## Using a Grenade

A Grenade can either be Thrown or it can be converted into traps in a form of Proximity Mines.

#### Throwing

When you take the :rsc-a: **Attack** action, you can replace one of your attacks to either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 120 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect depending on the grenade's effect. 

#### Plant

You can convert your grenades to proximity mines, provided you are proficient with [Tinker's Tools](../tools/artisan-tools.md#tinkers-tools) or [Gunsmith's Tools](../tools/artisan-tools.md#gunsmiths-tools). 

***Making the Mines.*** When you finish a Long Rest, you can convert a number of Grenades up to your Proficiency Bonus into a proximity mine using the aforementioned tools. 

***Planting the Mines.*** As a :rsc-a: **Utilise** action, you can plant them in the ground in your space. On the next turn, whenever a creature (includes you) enters a space within 20 feet of the proximity mine for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it explodes at that point, creating a particular effect depending on the grenade's effect.

It's obvious to observers that you're doing something when you take this Action.
