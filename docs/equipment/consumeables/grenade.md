Grenades are handheld explosive devices introduced to Antares by the Londoners. While the concept of delivering explosives in a throwable form isn't entirely new—often achieved through slinging spells or using crude, rudimentary versions—the Londoners have perfected and standardised these weapons. Their grenades offer a precise and reliable way to unleash destructive power, making them a valuable, though uncommon, tool on the battlefield.

## Using a Grenade

When you take the **Attack** action, you can replace one of your attacks with to throw a grenade at a point you can see within **60 feet**. The grenade will then explode, affecting an area centered on that point. Grenades can also be launched using a Grenade Launcher, in which case the range is determined by the weapon range (**120 ft.**). Refer to the Grenade Table to see the types of grenades available in this campaign.
