# Spell Scrolls (Revised)

A spell scroll contains the written words of a single spell in a mystical cipher. Any class can use a spell scroll, but how it is used depends on whether the spell is on your class's spell list.

## Casting a Spell Scroll

Casting a spell within a spell scroll differs whenever your class has the spell on their spell list or whenever your class has a spellcasting ability

#### Spell on Your Class's Spell List

If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can read the scroll and cast the spell as if you had prepared or known it, without needing material components. The spell's casting time remains the same. Once the spell is cast, the scroll's words fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

#### Spell Not on Your Class's Spell List.

If the spell is not on your class's spell list or if you do not have a spellcasting feature, you must make an Ability Check to determine whether you can cast it successfully. If you have a spellcasting ability, use that ability for the check. If you do not have a spellcasting ability, use Intelligence. 

The DC for this check equals ^^10 + the spell's level^^. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no effect. On a successful check, you cast the spell as if it were on your class's spell list, but you still require any material components(1) specified by the spell.

## Spell Scroll Attributes

The spell's level on the scroll determines its saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

## Copying a Spell from a Scroll

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just like spells in spellbooks. To copy a spell from a scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. Regardless of success or failure, the spell scroll is destroyed.
