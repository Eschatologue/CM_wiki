!!! homebrew "This ain't Vanilla"

    The following rules are homebrew intended to simplify using spell scrolls, because I certainly don’t have enough time to remember which class has which spells. So, I made it so that everyone can use them.

    These rules replace the original spell scroll rules. Crown & Misery uses it, but if you’re using this at another table, make sure to ask your DM.


# Spell Scrolls (Revised)

A spell scroll contains the written words of a single spell in a mystical cipher. Any class can use a spell scroll, but how it is used depends on whether the spell is on your class's spell list.

### Casting a Spell Scroll

Casting a spell from a spell scroll is simple and does not require any specific class features or spell lists. Any character can use a spell scroll, regardless of their class or abilities. 

### Using a Spell Scroll

To cast a spell from a spell scroll, you read the scroll and cast the spell. You do not need to make any checks, and no spellcasting ability is required. Material components are not needed unless the spell specifically consumes them (e.g., diamonds for *Revivify*). The spell’s casting time, range, and other properties remain unchanged.

If the spell requires an attack roll or imposes a saving throw, use the following values in the [Spell Scroll Table](#spell-scroll-table).  

## Spell Scroll Attributes

The spell's level on the scroll determines its saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

##### Spell Scroll Table

## Copying a Spell from a Scroll

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just like spells in spellbooks. To copy a spell from a scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. Regardless of success or failure, the spell scroll is destroyed.
