# Casting Units

Casting Units, also known as Arts Units, Weave Looms, Spellcasting Units, or (more informally) "Spell Scrolls with Skill Issue" and "Dumb Casters," depending on who you ask, represent a modernised take on traditional spell scrolls. Though not as potent as their predecessors, these devices allow even those without a natural connection to the Weave—sometimes referred to disparagingly as "Londoners"—to cast spells.

Casting Units emerged as a direct result of the brain drain that swept across Gallia after the establishment of the Caerdyf Tower of Arts and Valinor's Great Halls. Their invention was made possible through the fusion of sealed Elven knowledge, British craftsmanship, and Gallian spell-weaving standards. These units come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, catering to a range of magical needs and users.

## Function

Casting Units function as compact spell storage devices, effectively acting as miniature spellcasters. They come preloaded with spells, have their own set of spell slots, and include some form of conduit or mechanism to channel and cast the stored magic. However, they still require someone proficient in spellcasting to initially prepare and load the spells into them.

Despite their ability to perform magical functions, Casting Units themselves are not inherently magical. They remain mundane items unless the user imbues them with some additional form of magic or modifies them in a way that grants magical properties.

## Mechanics

Casting Units function as devices for casting preloaded spells. Each unit holds a set number of charges, which are expended when casting spells stored within it. The number of charges and the maximum level of spells that can be stored depend on the unit’s rarity and design.

### Charges and Spell Storage

A spellcaster must preload a Casting Unit with spells during a long rest. Each stored spell requires an amount of charges equal to its level (e.g., a level 2 spell requires 2 charges). When a spell is cast from the unit, the appropriate number of charges is consumed.

***Charges to Cast.*** To cast a spell, the user expends charges equal to the spell's level. Spells cannot be upcasted, even if additional charges are available. To restore a Charge, creature with Spellcasting or Pact Magic features can expend their own Spell Slots to restore an number of charges equal to the spell level during Short Rest.
  
***Casting Time.*** The spell’s casting time follows the normal rules for that spell (Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, etc.).
  
***Bonus to Hit and Save DC.*** Spells cast from a Casting Unit use the unit’s bonus to hit (for attack rolls) and Save DC (for spells requiring saving throws). The user’s spellcasting ability is not applied, even if they have one.

***Spell Level Limits.*** A Casting Unit can store spells up to a certain level, depending on its rarity. The unit cannot hold or cast spells of a higher level than its limit.

### Casting Unit Table

Each Casting Unit varies in its capabilities, including charges, memory capacity, bonus to hit, and Save DC. The Casting Unit table outlines these attributes based on the unit's rarity.
