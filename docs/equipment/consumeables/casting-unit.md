# Casting Units

Casting Units, also known as *Arts Units*, *Weave Looms*, *Spellcasting Units*, or (more informally) "*Spell Scrolls with Skill Issues*" and "*Dumb Casters*," depending on who you ask, are modernised versions of traditional spell scrolls. Though less potent than their predecessors, these devices allow even those without a natural connection to the Weave—sometimes referred to disparagingly as "Londoners"—to cast spells.

Casting Units emerged in response to the [brain drain](../../lore/glossary.md#toulouse-exodus) that swept across Gallia following the establishment of the Caerdyf Tower of Arts (Albion) and The Great Halls (Valinor). They were made possible through a fusion of Elven Fey magic, British craftsmanship, and Gallian spell-weaving standards. These units vary in shape and size, catering to a wide range of magical needs and users.

## Function

Casting Units act as portable spell storage devices. They hold spells, come with limited charges, and can cast magic through built-in mechanisms. A spellcaster must prepare and load spells into them. Despite their function, they aren't inherently magical unless modified.

## Mechanics

Each Casting Unit holds a set number of charges and has a maximum spell level it can store, depending on its rarity. Spellcasting units can often take an appereance of other arcane focus.

### Using Casting Units

:material-timer: **Casting Time:** Follows the normal casting time of the stored spell (Action, Bonus Action, Reaction).  
:spell-concentration: **Concentration:** If the spell requires Concentration, the user must maintain it.  
:material-target-variant: **Bonus to Hit and Save DC:** Spells use the unit's bonus to hit and Save DC. The user's own spellcasting ability isn't applied.

### Storing Spells

:material-inbox-full: **Spell Limits:** A unit can only store spells up to its rarity's max level.  
:material-memory: **Memory Capacity:** A unit can store spells based on its capacity. Spells take up space equal to 1 + their level. Cantrips count as level 0 spells.  
:material-battery-high: **Charges:** Casting a spell uses 1 charge plus its spell level. Cantrips use 1 charges.

### Reloading and Recharging

:material-folder-download: **Store Spells:** A spellcaster can load or change the spells it prepares or know into the unit during a Long Rest.  
:material-battery-charging-10: **Recharge:** Spend spell slots to restore charges (1 charge per spell slot level).
