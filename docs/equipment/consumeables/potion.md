In this D&D, potions come in various types, from basic healing potions to those that grant specific buffs to those who consumes it. These items are typically regarded as magical byproducts, so their availability depends on the familiarity of a particular shop or nation with magical goods.

## Drinking or Consuming

In Crown & Misery, where combat can be exceptionally lethal, rules regarding potion consumption differ slightly from standard PHB'24 rulings, in which you can choose between taking either :rsc-action: **Action** or :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to consume the potion.

- :rsc-action: **Action:** Grants you the full maximum benefit of the potion. If the potion requires you to roll dice for its effect, you gain the maximum possible roll for those dice instead.
- :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action:** Requires you to roll the dice associated with the potion or elixir's description to receive its benefits.
