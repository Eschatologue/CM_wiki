In this D&D, potions come in various types, from basic healing potions to those that grant specific buffs to those who consumes it. These items are typically regarded as magical byproducts, so their availability depends on the familiarity of a particular shop or nation with magical goods.

## Drinking or Consuming

In Crown & Misery, where combat can be exceptionally lethal, rules regarding potion consumption differ slightly from standard PHB rulings, in which you can choose between spending your either :rsc-action: **Action** or your :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to consume the potion.

- :rsc-action:**Action:** Grants you the full maximum benefit of the potion. If the potion requires you to roll dice for its effect, you gain the maximum possible roll for those dice instead.
- :rsc-bonus-action:**Bonus Action:** Requires you to roll the dice associated with the potion or elixir's description to receive its benefits.

## Inventory Slots

- **Small [S]:** Potions or elixirs in this category are compact and easily portable. They take up 1 inventory slot and can be stacked up to 8.

- **Medium [M]:** Potions or elixirs in this category are akin to standard water flasks or pastries from Gallian bakeries. They take up 1 inventory slot and can be stacked up to 4.
 
- **Large [L]:** Potions or elixirs in this category are larger, comparable to small wizard tomes or mountaineering water flasks. They take up 1 inventory slot and can be stacked up to 2.

- **Huge [XL]:** These potions or elixirs are significantly larger or more potent, making them unwieldy to store closely together. They occupy 1 inventory slot each and cannot be stacked. Their sizes vary greatly, ranging from as large as a troll's head to as small as a ballpoint pen, but regardless of size, caution should be exercised when storing them.
