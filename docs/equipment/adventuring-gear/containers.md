# Containers

**Containers** are items or pieces of equipment designed to hold or store other items. They are particularly useful for carrying items in bulk or for better organisation during travel or exploration. Common examples include backpacks, baskets, and magical items like the Bag of Holding.

However, **you cannot store one container within another of the same type**â€”for instance, placing a backpack inside another backpack or a Bag of Holding inside another Bag of Holding. This is to prevent exploiting containers to create an infinite inventory. 

That said, this rule is ultimately subject to the **DM's discretion**, who may allow exceptions depending on the campaign's needs or circumstances.
