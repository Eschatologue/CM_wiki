# Firearm Augmentation

With the release of the 2024 edition of the Player's Handbook, all Cold Weapons gained new mechanics known as [Weapon Mastery](index.md#mastery-properties), allowing them to produce additional effects upon hitting a target. This mechanic reflects the wielder's mastery and skill in wielding such weapons.

However, the power of firearms comes from the weapon itself, not the strength or skill of the user. A user can be as strong as they wish, but they are ultimately limited by the weapon's inherent capabilities.

To balance this, those who choose to wield firearms can now access a new mechanic called "**Augmentations**." These allow the wielders to modify their weapons with various attachments, enabling them to personalise and enhance their firearms according to their preferences.

## Mechanics

As the name suggests, firearm Augmentations are available only to firearms that meet the **prerequisites**. To apply, make, or change an Augmentation on a firearm, the following conditions must be met:

### Tools and Proficiency

***Gunsmith's Tools.*** You must have a Gunsmith's Tools to modify firearms. Your Gunsmith's Tool acts as a storage for your Augmentation

***Proficiency.*** You must be proficient with both the firearm you wish to Augment and Gunsmith's Tools.

### Time Requirements

***Creating an Augmentation.*** Creating a new Augmentation follows the rulings in [Equipment Crafting](../crafting.md#time).

***Changing an Augmentation.*** Attatching or changing any number of Augmentation on a firearm requires a Long Rest, unless you have Expertise with Gunsmith's Tools, in which case it takes a Short Rest.

### Cost

***Material Costs.*** The cost of an Augmentation represents its base purchase price.

:   Once you have crafted or bought an Augmentation for a particular firearm category, you can reuse that same Augmentation for other firearms of the same category without additional cost.

### Stackable

***Stacking Benefits.***  If an Augmentation is marked as "stackable," you can apply two or more of the same Augmentation to a single firearm, and their benefits will stack.

:   Keep in mind that stackable Augmentations can change the parameters of specific weapon properties, such as  :weapon-prop-reload: **Reload** or  :weapon-prop-automatic: **Automatic**, allowing those properties to function more effectively.

:   However, certain weapon properties themselves do not stack. For example, applying two of the same Augmentation that grants a weapon property like :weapon-prop-sighted: **Sighted** will not double the benefit of that specific property.

### Augmentation Limits

You can create any number of different Augmentations for firearms, with the total number of Augmentations you can have equipped at any one time not exceeding your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if your proficiency bonus is 3, you can have a total of 3 Augmentations equipped across your firearms. This could be distributed as 2 Augmentations on one firearm and 1 on another, but you cannot exceed the total of 3 Augmentations across all equipped firearms. Therefore, you cannot have 3 on one firearm and 3 on another, as that would exceed your proficiency bonus.

!!! note "Augment Limit"

    There is no limit to the number of Augmentations that a single firearm can hold; your Proficiency Bonus is the only restriction on how many can be actively equipped at one time.

## Augmentation Options

Below are Firearm Augmentations available in Crown & Misery.
