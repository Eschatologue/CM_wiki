# Gaming Sets & Musical Instrument Table

## Gaming Sets

Proficiency with a gaming set applies to one type of game, such as Three-Dragon Ante or games of chance that use dice.

***Components.*** A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as a complete deck of cards or a board and tokens.

***History.*** Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected to or prominent historical figures involved with it.

***Insight.*** Playing games with someone is a good way to gain understanding of their personality, granting you a better ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood.

***Sleight of Hand.*** Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards, or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.

***Performance.*** Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.
