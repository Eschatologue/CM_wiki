# Backpacks

Backpacks are an additional equipment that your character can use they increase how much you can carry. You can only benefit form one backpack at a time, and you can't put a backpack inside another backpack. *This isn't Minecraft, and you don't have shulker boxes.*

**Retreiving Item.** Taking an item from a backpack requires an :rsc-action:**Action**, representing the time it takes to search for and retrieve an item. As such, you can't use an item that is inside your backpack until you have used an :rsc-action:**Action** to pull it out.

Larger backpacks exist in this D&D that you can find.
