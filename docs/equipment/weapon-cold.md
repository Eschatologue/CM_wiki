Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

[Cold weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_weapon) encompass all non-magical melee and ranged weapons. These weapons are categorized based on their properties, usage, and the damage they deal. 

Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.

## Weapon Proficiency

Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. 

There are two weapon categories, which are simple and martial. 

**Simple Weapns**. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency, often found in the hands of commoners.

**Martial Weapons**. Requires more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

## Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition

You need a free hand to draw ammunition and load a one-handed weapon and at the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

#### Automatic

Once per round, when you the the attack action with this weapon on your turn, you can choose to make additional attacks (make seperate attack rolls) up to the number in the parenthesis. 

The additional attacks are always made with disadvantage regardless of circumstances and expends ammunitions equal to the number of attacks.

#### Finesse

When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy 

Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weaponâ€™s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively. Item with this property take 1 additional inventory space.

#### Light

A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

#### Loading

Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Range

This weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

#### Reach

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.

#### Reload

This weapon can be used to make a number of attacks before it must be reloaded. If you are proficient with the weapon, reloading it takes a bonus action; otherwise, reloading it takes an action. Some weapons require an action or longer to reload, even if you have proficiency, which is specified in the Reload property. If reloading a weapon requires longer than one action, the weapon can't be used to make attacks until reloading is finished.

#### Thrown

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

#### Two-Handed

This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

#### Versatile

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

#### Sighted

This weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls made against targets within 20 feet.

## Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Lance.** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.

**Net.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
