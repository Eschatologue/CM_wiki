# Services

This section outlines services and other expenses that adventurers might spend money on.

## Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (DM's choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

| Lifestyle | Description | Cost per Day |
|---|---|--:|
| **Wretched** | You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside. | Free |
| **Squalid** | You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals. | 1 SP |
| **Poor** | You spend frugally for your necessities | 2 SP |
| **Modest** | You support yourself at an average level. | 10 SP |
| **Comfortable** | You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries | 20 SP |
| **Wealthy** | You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants. | 40 SP |
| **Aristocratic** | You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise. | 100 SP |
