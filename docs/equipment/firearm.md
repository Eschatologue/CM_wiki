In Antares, magic is deeply integrated into daily life, and an individual's worth can be determined not only by their wealth but also by their mastery of arcane power, although this varies across different regions. The destruction of the elven empire brought significant changes to the world, including the introduction of firearms by the newly established nation of London.

While firearms may not possess exceptional killing power, they prove more suitable for the average British citizen due to their lack of magical ability and limited proficiency in most melee combat compared to the native inhabitants of Antares. One notable advantage of firearms is their superior range compared to crossbows and bows. The construction of firearms is complex, requiring a specific industrial standard found only in London. Additionally, firearm users must possess basic shooting skills, including precise aiming, recoil control, and the ability to maintain the weapon with precision, stability, and intelligence.

London, as the inventor of firearms, maintains tight control over their invention and production to prevent technology leakage and misuse. This tight control contributes to the exorbitant cost and difficulty in obtaining firearms, even through legitimate means. Furthermore, procuring the expensive and rare bullets adds to the impracticality of these weapons. 

However, British citizens with the proper permits can access firearms and ammunition either within Albion or at British Embassies located throughout Antares.
