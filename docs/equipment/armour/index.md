Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armour types, ranging from leather armour to chain mail to costly plate armour, with several other kinds of armour in between.

## Understanding Armour Class (AC)

Armour Class (AC) is a measurement of how difficult a creature is to be hit by an attack. In order to successfully hit a creature, the results of an attack roll must have a number equal to or greater than the target's Armour Class. AC can be increased by equipping armour and shields, by selecting certain feats when leveling up, or utilizing certain spells.

### Base AC from Armor

Each type of armor provides a base AC. The three main categories of armor are light, medium, and heavy, and each has different rules for how they interact with your Dexterity modifier.

#### Light Armor

- **Padded:** Base AC 11 + Dexterity modifier.
- **Leather:** Base AC 11 + Dexterity modifier.
- **Studded Leather:** Base AC 12 + Dexterity modifier.

#### Medium Armor

- **Hide:** Base AC 12 + Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2).
- **Chain Shirt:** Base AC 13 + Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2).
- **Scale Mail:** Base AC 14 + Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2), disadvantage on Stealth checks.
- **Breastplate:** Base AC 14 + Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2).
- **Half Plate:** Base AC 15 + Dexterity modifier (maximum of +2), disadvantage on Stealth checks.

#### Heavy Armor

- **Ring Mail:** Base AC 14, disadvantage on Stealth checks.
- **Chain Mail:** Base AC 16, disadvantage on Stealth checks, requires Strength 13.
- **Splint:** Base AC 17, disadvantage on Stealth checks, requires Strength 15.
- **Plate:** Base AC 18, disadvantage on Stealth checks, requires Strength 15.

#### Using a Shield

Using a shield adds bonus to your AC equal to the amount stated. This bonus is applied in addition to the base AC provided by your armor.

??? tip "Example Calculations"

    Here are some examples to illustrate how to calculate AC for different character setups:

    **Light Armor Example:**

        - A rogue with a Dexterity modifier of +3 wearing studded leather (base AC 12).
        - AC = 12 (base) + 3 (Dex) = 15.

    **Medium Armor Example:**

        - A ranger with a Dexterity modifier of +3 wearing half plate (base AC 15, max +2 Dex).
        - AC = 15 (base) + 2 (Dex, max allowed) = 17.

    **Heavy Armor Example:**

        - A paladin wearing plate armor (base AC 18) and using a shield (+2).
        - AC = 18 (base) + 2 (shield) = 20.

    **Unarmored Defense Example (Barbarian):**

        - A barbarian with a Dexterity modifier of +2 and a Constitution modifier of +3.
        - AC = 10 + 2 (Dex) + 3 (Con) = 15.

    **Unarmored Defense Example (Monk):**

        - A monk with a Dexterity modifier of +3 and a Wisdom modifier of +2.
        - AC = 10 + 3 (Dex) + 2 (Wis) = 15.

#### Special Considerations

- **Stealth Disadvantage:** Some armors (e.g., scale mail, splint, plate) impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Strength Requirements:** Some heavy armors require a minimum Strength score to avoid movement , which is -10 ft of movement speed.
- **Magical Armor:** Magical armors can provide additional bonuses to AC or other special benefits.

## How much AC do I need?

Short Answer? *all of them*. More AC is always better, it is better to not get hit rather than expending hit points.

Long Answer is as follow:  

Armour Class becomes more useful the greater it is - the difference in effectiveness between 20 and 19 AC is greater than the difference in effectiveness between 16 and 15.

To illustrate this, if a defender has 15 AC and 10 HP, and the attacker has +5 (50% chance to hit) to attack rolls, and deals 2 damage per attack, the defender would on average survive for 10 turns.

If the defender's AC was increased to 16 (45% chance to be hit), they would instead survive for an average of 11.1 rounds (an 11% increase in effectiveness).

Meanwhile, if the defender has 19 AC (30% chance to be hit), they would survive for an average of 16.66 rounds. If their AC was increased to 20 (25% chance to be hit), they would be able to survive for an average of 20 rounds (a 20% increase in effectiveness).

The difference between 25 and 24 is even greater, with a 100% increase in effectiveness (50 vs 100 rounds).

The Armour table collects the most commonly available types of armour found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armour, medium armour, and heavy armour. Many warriors supplement their armour with a shield.
