# Armour

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armour types, ranging from leather armour to chain mail to costly plate armour, with several other kinds of armour in between.

## Understanding Armour Class (AC)

Armour Class (AC) is a measurement of how difficult a creature is to be hit by an attack. In order to successfully hit a creature, the results of an attack roll must have a number equal to or greater than the target's Armour Class. AC can be increased by equipping armour and shields, by selecting certain feats when leveling up, or utilizing certain spells.

Below is tha formulaa

$$
AC = 10+\text{Dexterity Modifier}+\text{Other Bonuses}
$$

## Formula

The default formula that determines AC is:

:   `10 + Dexterity modifier + armour bonus + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- The AC bonus from Dexterity modifier may be capped when wearing medium and is ignored entirely when wearing heavy armour.

- Medium armour caps the Dexterity Modifier to +2, whereas heavy armour ignores the modifier entirely.

- Shields will grant the listed AC bonus to whomever equips it, regardless of which hand they are currently using to wield it.

### Other formulas
Unarmoured creatures may use one of the following different formulas if they have certain features.

- Mage Armour(Spell) or Draconic Resilience(Racial Feature):

:   `13 + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- Unarmoured Defence (Barbarian):

:   `10 + Constitution modifier + Dexterity modifier + shield bonus + other bonuses and penalties`

- Unarmoured Defence (Monk):

:   `10 + Wisdom modifier + Dexterity modifier + other bonuses and penalties`

## How much AC do I need?

Short Answer? *all of them*. More AC is always better, regardless of your class. 

Long Answer is as follow:  

Armour Class becomes more useful the greater it is - the difference in effectiveness between 20 and 19 AC is greater than the difference in effectiveness between 16 and 15.

To illustrate this, if a defender has 15 AC and 10 HP, and the attacker has +5 (50% chance to hit) to attack rolls, and deals 2 damage per attack, the defender would on average survive for 10 turns.

If the defender's AC was increased to 16 (45% chance to be hit), they would instead survive for an average of 11.1 rounds (an 11% increase in effectiveness).

Meanwhile, if the defender has 19 AC (30% chance to be hit), they would survive for an average of 16.66 rounds. If their AC was increased to 20 (25% chance to be hit), they would be able to survive for an average of 20 rounds (a 20% increase in effectiveness).

The difference between 25 and 24 is even greater, with a 100% increase in effectiveness (50 vs 100 rounds).

The Armour table collects the most commonly available types of armour found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armour, medium armour, and heavy armour. Many warriors supplement their armour with a shield.
