## Armour Proficiency

Anyone can put on a suit of armour or strap a shield to an arm. Only those *proficient* in the armour's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you Proficiency with certain types of armour. 

If you wear armour that you lack Proficiency with, you gain several affliction: 

- :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on any :d20-check:**Ability Check**
- :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on :d20-save: **Saving Throw**
- :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** that involves *Strength* or *Dexterity*
- You can't cast spells.

## Armour Class (AC)

*See [Armour Class](./index.md#what-is-armour-class-ac) for more details*

Armour protects its wearer from attacks. The armour (and shield) you wear determines your base Armour Class.

## Stealth

If the Armour table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column, the wearer has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

## Armour Types

### Light Armour

Made from supple and thin materials, light armour favours agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. 

| :material-text: **NAME** | :rsc-silver: **COST** |  :material-shield: **ARMOUR CLASS(AC)** | :material-arm-flex: **STRENGTH** | :material-eye-off: **STEALTH** |
| :-- | --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Padded | 50 sp | 11 + Dex modifier | - | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |
| Leather | 100 sp | 11 + Dex modifier | - | - |
| Studded Leather | 450 sp | 12 + Dex modifier | - | - |

If you wear light armour, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armour type to determine your Armour Class.

- **Padded.** Padded armour consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.
- **Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armour are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armour is made of softer and more flexible materials.
- **Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

### Medium Armour

Medium armour offers more protection than light armour, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armour, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armour type to determine your Armour Class.

| :material-text: **NAME** | :rsc-silver: **COST** |  :material-shield: **ARMOUR CLASS(AC)** | :material-arm-flex: **STRENGTH** | :material-eye-off: **STEALTH** |
| :-- | --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Hide | 100 sp | 12 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | - |
| Chain Shirt | 500 sp | 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | - |
| Scale Mail | 500 sp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |
| Breastplate | 4,000 sp | 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | - |
| Half Plate | 7,500 sp | 15 + Dex modifier (max 2) | - | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |

- **Hid⁠e.** This crude armour consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folks who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armour.
- **Chain⁠ Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armour offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
- **Scale M⁠ail.** This armour consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
- **Breastp⁠late.** This armour consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armour protects the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
- **Half⁠ Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

### Heavy Armour

Of all the armour categories, heavy armour offers the best protection. These suits of armour cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armour doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armour Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

If the Armour table shows 'STR 13' or 'STR 15' in the Strength column for an armour type, the armour reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.

| :material-text: **NAME** | :rsc-silver: **COST** |  :material-shield: **ARMOUR CLASS(AC)** | :material-arm-flex: **STRENGTH** | :material-eye-off: **STEALTH** |
| :-- | --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Ring Mail | 300 sp | 14 | - | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |
| Chainmail | 750 sp | 16 | Str 13 | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |
| Splint | 2,000 sp | 17 | Str 15 | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |
| Plate | 15,000 sp | 18 | Str 15 | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |

- **Ring⁠ Mail.** This armour is leather armour with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armour against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armour.
- **Chain⁠ Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
- **Splint.** This armour is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
- **Plate.** Plate armour consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armour. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

### Shield

A shield is made from wood or metal (can be anything really) and is carried in one hand. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.

| :material-text: **NAME** | :rsc-silver: **COST** |  :material-shield: **ARMOUR CLASS(AC)** | :material-arm-flex: **STRENGTH** | :material-eye-off: **STEALTH** |
| :-- | --: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Buckler* | 50 sp | +1 | - | - |
| Shield | 100 sp | +2 | - | - |
| Tower** | 400 sp | +3 | Str 16 | :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** |

- **Buckler**. While holding a Buckler shield. You can use a :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. You can use a weapon with *Versatile* property even if you have a Buckler in the other hand.
- **Tower.** While holding a Tower shield, your speed is reduced by 10 ft.

## Getting Into and Out of Armour

The time it takes to don or doff armour depends on the armour's category.

- **Don.** This is the time it takes to put on armour. You benefit from the armour's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armour.

- **Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off armour. If you have help, reduce this time by half.

#### Donning and Doffing Armour

| Category | Don | Doff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light Armour | 1 minute | 1 minute |
| Medium Armour | 5 minutes | 1 minute |
| Heavy Armour | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shields | 1 action | 1 action |

## Adamantine Armor

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.
