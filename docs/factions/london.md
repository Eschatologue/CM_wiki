# London
The new beating heart of the British Empire, a thriving nation nestled within what was once a verdant forest claimed by the elves. London stands as a beacon of prosperity and military might, earning its place as one of Antares' most influential and formidable nations.

Despite the absence of traditional arcane technology that has dominated Antares' history, London has swiftly risen to prominence through its groundbreaking technological advancements. As a dominant force, London's military leverages these innovations, incorporating firearms, artillery, dreadnoughts, airships, and power armor into its elite and specialized branches.

In present times, London continues to exert a lasting influence across Antares. However, the priorities of its parliament have shifted from solely projecting power to encompassing the improvement of its citizens' livelihoods while also suppressing the ever-growing elven rebellion within its borders.

## Background

How the present-day London came to be remains a subject of scholarly debate. The transformation of a nation predominantly composed of refugees into one of the strongest powers in Antares is nothing short of a miracle. Recorded encounters with these "tea addicts" date back several decades before the fall of the Great Elven Empire, coinciding with the location where New London now stands. Elven records indicate their arrival through a mysterious structure known as "The Northern Gate," an ancient ruin said to have existed for as long as the oldest high-elf can remember.

One fateful day, the statue guarding the gate illuminated, and its gates opened. Expecting invaders from the skies, the elves were surprised to encounter a large group of humans clad in rags, wounded, and some even missing limbs. These individuals identified themselves collectively as "British," emphasizing their nationality over their raceâ€”a concept that puzzled many. Despite their humble appearance, the British displayed remarkable intelligence and skills across various disciplines, bringing invaluable knowledge to this new world. In a remarkably short span of time, the refugee population exploded, leading to the rapid expansion of their settlements. Camps evolved into towns, then cities, eventually rivaling the grandeur of some of the largest dwarven settlements. However, as their influence grew, the elves, who had initially provided sanctuary, began to perceive them as a significant threat.

During this period, elven politics underwent a significant shift toward fanaticism and extreme nationalism. The elves, who possessed superior arcane abilities that the British lacked, began infiltrating British territories under the pretext of reclaiming ancestral lands. Hostilities escalated as the elves made increasingly aggressive moves against the British government, culminating in abductions and the enslavement of British citizens when the government refused to share technological advancements with the elves.

The expansion of British cities came at a cost, as more forested areas were cleared to accommodate urban growth. Initially disregarded by the elves, the extensive deforestation eventually reached a tipping point, prompting the elves to take action against what they perceived as the desecration of their land. Tensions simmered until they erupted into open conflict, leading to a war between the two factions.

The conflict, known as "the great split," was among the deadliest and bloodiest in Antares history, marked by unfettered brutality and open warfare between the forces of nature and elven arcane superiority against British war machines and industrial might. It represented a pivotal moment in Antares, where those lacking arcane prowess asserted dominance for the first time. Despite the British gaining the upper hand, the war remained brutal.

In a desperate final move, the British breached one of the most sacred and protected places of the elves, felling Yggdrassil, the legendary tree of life. This act was not only a strategic blow to the elves but also a symbolic triumph for the British, signaling their defiance against elven supremacy and the dawn of a new era in Antares history.
