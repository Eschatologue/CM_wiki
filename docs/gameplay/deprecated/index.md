# Combat Basic

The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armour. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard's spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters.

Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master.

The Dungeon Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. "You" can also mean the character or monster that you control.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. 

During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

## Your Turn

During your turn, you can do the following on any order:

- Move up to your :rsc-speed: **Speed**
- Take one :rsc-action: **Action**
- Take one :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** (If you have a class feature that uses it)

### Initiative

> *"Roll for Initiative!"*

Initiative determines the order in which characters and creatures act during combat in Dungeons & Dragons. Intitiative is made with a :d20-check: Dexterity **Ability Check**

#### Establishing the Order

1. **Turn Order:** The DM organizes all participants from highest to lowest initiative roll. This order dictates who acts first, second, and so on, throughout each round of combat.
2. **Tie-Breakers:** If two or more participants have the same initiative roll, the participant with the higher Dexterity score goes first.

#### Initiative in Combat

1. **Rounds:** Combat is divided into rounds. Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world, and every participant gets one turn per round.
2. **Turns:** On their turn, participants can move and take one or more actions (e.g., attack, cast a spell, use an item).
3. **Order of Actions:** Participants act in the order established by the initiative rolls, from highest to lowest.
4. **Repeating Order:** After everyone has taken their turn, a new round begins, starting again from the top of the initiative order.

### :rsc-action:{ .lg .pad-r } Action

### :rsc-bonus-action:{ .lg .pad-r } Bonus Action

### :rsc-reaction:{ .lg .pad-r } Reaction

:rsc-reaction: **Reactions** are special actions you can take in response to certain triggers, even when it's not your turn. You can take one :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** per round. Common reactions include:

- **Opportunity Attack:** When an enemy moves out of your reach.
- **Casting a Spell:** Some spells, like *[Shield](../../spells/1st-level.md#shield)* or *[Counterspell](../../spells/3rd-level.md#counterspell)*, can be cast using :rsc-reaction: **Reaction**.

### Dealing Damage

*Main Article: [Damage](damage-healing.md#damage)*

Roll damage **based in the description of the attack** being used. Damage can often involve multiple dice.

Damage is assigned a damage type based on the weapon or effect inflicting the damage, this includes:

**Vulnerability.** Takes double damage of the corresponding damage type.

**Resistance.** Takes half damage of the corresponding damage type. 

**Immunity.** Takes no damage of the corresponding damage type.

### Moving in Combat

*Main Article: [Movement](movement.md)*

On your turn, you can move up to your :rsc-speed: **Speed**.

| Drop Prone | Give yourself the Prone condition | none |
| Difficult Terrain | Special terrains that difficult to cross | Movement cost is doubled |
| Climb, Crawl, Swim | Count as Difficult Terrain | Movevement cost is doubled |

#### Breaking Movement

You can break up your Movement on Your Turn, using some of your speed before and after your :rsc-action: **Action**. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your :rsc-action: **Action**, and then move 20 feet.

#### Moving Between Attacks

If you take an :rsc-action: **Action** that includes more than one weapon Attack, you can break up your Movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a Fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an Attack, move 15 feet, and then Attack again.
