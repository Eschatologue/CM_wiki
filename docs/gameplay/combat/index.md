# Combat

Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash betweer two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **Round** reoresents about 6 seconds in the game world.

During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn, The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.

### Combat Step by Step

Combat unfolds in these steps:

1. **Establish Position**  
The DM determines where all the characters and monster are located. Given the adventurers marching order or their stated position in the room or other location, the DM figures out where adversaries are–how far away, and what dicrection.

2. **Roll Initiative**  
Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiativem determining the order of combatants' turns.

3. **Take Turns**  
Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until fighting stops.

### Initiative

> *"Roll for Initiative!"*

Initiative determines the order in which characters and creatures act during combat in Dungeons & Dragons. Intitiative is made with a :d20-check: Dexterity **Ability Check**. The DM rolls for monsters. For a group of indentical creatures, the DM makes a singe roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.

#### Surprise

If a combatant is suprised by combat starting, that combatant has :d20-disadv: Disadvantage on their Initiative roll, this is relevant during ambushes.

#### Initiative Order

#### **Turn Order.** The DM organizes all participants from highest to lowest initiative roll. This order dictates who acts first, second, and so on, throughout each round of combat.

#### **Tie-Breakers.** If two or more participants have the same initiative roll, the participant with the higher Dexterity score goes first.

### Your Turn

During your turn, you can do the following on any order:

- Move up to your :rsc-speed: **Speed**
- Take one :rsc-action: **Action**
- Take one :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** (If you have a feature that uses it)

#### Communicating

You can communicate however you are able–through bried uttarances and gestures–as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your :rsc-action: nor your move.

Extended communications, such as detailes explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a foe, requies an action. The **Influence** action is the main way you try to influence a monster.

#### Interacting with Things

You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during either your move as you stride toward a foe.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the **Utilise** action. Some magic items and other special object always requires an action to use, as stted in their descriptions.

#### Doing Nothing

You can forgo moving, takking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider taking the defensive **Dodge** action or the **Ready** action to delay acting.

### Ending Combat

Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or koncked out, or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also end when both sides agree to end it.

## Movement and Position

On your turn, tou can move a distance equal to yout Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.

Your movement can include climbing, crawling, jumping, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with your regular movement, or they can constitute your entire move.

However you're moving with your Speed, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from it until it is used up or until you are done moving, whichever comes first.

A character's Speed is determined during character creation. A monster Sp4eed is noted in the monster's stat block. See the rules glossary for more about Speed aswell as about special speeds, such as a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.

### Grid-based Movement

Playing on a grid follows these rules:

#### Squares

On a grid, each square represents 5 feet. A character with 30 feet of movement speed can move up to 6 squares per turn.

#### Speed

Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the Grid using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translate into 6 squuares. Consider writing your Speed in sqyares on your character sheet

#### Entering a Square

To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It cost 1 square (5 feet) of movement to enter an unoccupied square that's adjacent to your space. A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter (10 feet). Other effects might make a square cost even more.

#### Corners

Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills the space.

#### Ranges

To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting nf the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

### Difficult Terrain

Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult Terrain; Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Difficult Terrain.

Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count as Difficult terrain

### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your move, using some of its movement before and after any action, Bonus Action, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For example, if you have a 
Speed of 30 feet, you could go 10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.

### Dropping Prone

On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condition without using an action or any of your Speed, but you can't do so if your Speed is 0.

### Creature Size

A creature belongs to a size category, which ditermines the width of the square space the creature occupies on a map, as showns on the Creature Size table and Space table. That table lists the sizes from smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature's space is the area that it effectively controls in combat and the area it needs to fight effectively.

##### Creature Size and Space

| Size | Space (Feet) | Space (Square) |
|---|---|---|
| Tiny | 2½ by 2½ feet | 4 per square |
| Small | 5 by 5 feet | 1 square |
| Medium | 5 by 5 feet | 1 square |
| Large | 10 by 10 feet | 4 square (2 by 2) |
| Huge | 15 by 15 feet | 9 square (3 by 3) |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 feet | 16 square (4 by 4) |

### Moving around Other Creatures

During your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creatyre that has the Incapacitated condition, a Tiny creature, or a creatyre that is two sizes larger or smaller than you.

You can't willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creatyre. If you somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the Prone condition unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.
