# Movement and Positioning (Grid-Based)

Movement and positioning are crucial aspects of combat in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), especially when using a grid to represent the battlefield. Here's how it works.

## Movement Basics

**Movement Speed.** Each character has a movement speed determined by their race and class. This is the number of feet a character can move on their turn.

**Grid Representation.** On a grid, each square represents 5 feet. A character with 30 feet of movement speed can move up to 6 squares per turn.

## Types of Movement

**Walking.** Moving normally across the grid, using your standard movement speed.
   
**Dashing.** Taking the Dash action doubles your movement speed for the turn.(1)

!!! tip "Dash using other Actions"

    Some class feature allows you to use Dash as :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** instead of an :rsc-action: **Action**, a well known one is the rogue's *cunning action* and monk's *step of the wind*. Without specific class feature, Dash always uses an Action. Spells can also grants you the same benefit.

**Difficult Terrain.** Moving through difficult terrain (e.g., thick underbrush, rubble) costs double the movement cost.

**Climbing, Swimming, Crawling.** These types of movement usually cost extra movement, often double.(1)

## Positioning
Characters typically occupy a single 5-foot square on the grid. Larger creatures might occupy multiple squares (e.g., a creature with a Large size occupies a 10x10-foot area, or 4 squares).

### Adjacency 

Characters are considered adjacent if they are in squares next to each other (including diagonals).

- Being adjacent to an enemy allows for melee attacks.
- Moving out of an adjacent square without using the Disengage action provokes an opportunity attack.

### Cover 

Positioning behind obstacles or other characters can provide cover, granting bonuses to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
   
- **Half Cover.** +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
- **Three-Quarters Cover.** +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
- **Total Cover.** Cannot be targeted directly by attacks or spells.

## Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.
