## Damage

Damage is a number that represents how deadly a threat is. When a creature takes damage, they subtract that amount of damage from their current amount of hit points.

Damage is dealt with attacks and other harmful actions, as well as by a variety of conditions.

### Damage Rolls

The base damage dealt by a weapon, spell, class action, or condition is usually determined by a *damage roll*. Damage rolls always have an associated damage type that is given following the dice notation

#### Damage Modifiers

Modifiers added to damage rolls are only added per source, even if multiple dice are rolled.

Which ability score modifier is added to a damage roll depends on the attack:

- **Weapon Attacks.** When making weapon attacks, roll the damage dice associated with the weapon and add any relevant modifiers.(1)
  { .annotate }
    
    1. Strength for melee weapons and Dexterity for ranged weapons and weapons with *finesse*(1).
        { .annotate }

        1. **Finesse** is a weapon property.
   
            When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

- **Spell Attacks.** Ability score modifiers are not normally added to damage rolls dealt by spells or spell attacks, unless specifically stated otherwise in the spell's description, or if enabled by some feature.

Proficiency Bonuses are only added to damage rolls unless the attack being used explicitly says so.

**Example:**

- **Damaging with Weapons.** A successful attack with a Dagger does a base of 1d4 Piercing damage. This means a single four-sided die :die-d4: is rolled to determine the damage, for a total of 1 to 4 piercing damage. 
  
    Most weapons use a single damage die, but some two-handed weapons use two: a successful attack with Greatswords does 2d6 Slashing damage, rolling two six-sided dice "material-dice-d6: for a total of 2 to 12 slashing damage. 

- **Damaging with Spells.** Damaging spells typically roll more dice: for example, being caught in a Fireball will cause 8d6 Fire damage, though a successful Saving Throw can reduce it to half.

### Critical Hits

Rolling a natural 20 on an attack roll results in a Critical Hit, dealing double damage.
 
**Example**: A ranger scoring a Critical Hit with a short sword (1d6 piercing damage) + 3 (Dexterity modifier). The ranger rolled 3 on the :die-d6: d6, dealing a total of 6 damage and it is doubled to 12 Piercing damage as a result.

### Resistance, Vulnerability, and Immunity

#### Resistance

Resistance to a damage type means that the damage from that type is halved. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage and takes 12 points of fire damage, it only takes 6 points.

#### Vulnerability

Vulnerability to a damage type means that the damage from that type is doubled. For example, if a creature is vulnerable to cold damage and takes 10 points of cold damage, it takes 20 points instead.

#### Immunity

Immunity to a damage type means that the creature takes no damage from that type. For example, if a creature is immune to poison damage, it takes no damage from poison, regardless of the amount dealt.

## Healing

Healing is the process of restoring lost hit points to a creature.

Healing can never restore more hit points than a creature's hit point maximum, and cannot restore temporary hit points. Player characters are generally only able to heal their party members and allies, not hostile or neutral creatures.

### Healing Spells and Abilities

Characters can regain HP through spells (e.g., Cure Wounds, Healing Word), class abilities (e.g., Lay on Hands, Second Wind), and potions.

**Example**

- A cleric casts Cure Wounds, which heals 1d8 + the caster's spellcasting modifier.
- A fighter uses Second Wind to heal 1d10 + their fighter level.

#### Short Rest

During a short rest (at least 1 hour), characters can spend Hit Dice to regain HP. Roll the Hit Dice and add the character's Constitution modifier for each die rolled.

**Example:** A level 5 wizard can roll up to 5d6 (wizard Hit Die) and add their Constitution modifier to each roll to regain HP.

#### Long Rest

During a long rest (at least 8 hours), characters regain all lost HP and up to half of their maximum Hit Dice.
