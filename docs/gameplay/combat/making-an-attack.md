## Making an Attack

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a ranged weapon, or making an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** as part of a spell, an attack follows a simple structure:

1. **Choose a target.** Select a creature, object, or location within your attack's range.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The DM decides if the target has cover and whether you have :d20-adv: **Advantage** or :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**. Spells, abilities, and other effects can also modify your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** Make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage unless specified otherwise. Some attacks have additional effects.

If you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.

## Attack Rolls
*Main article: [Dice Rolls](../dice-rolls.md#attack-rolls)*

To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. 

### Modifiers to the Roll

- **Ability Modifier:** For melee attacks, use Strength. For ranged attacks, use Dexterity. Weapons with the :weapon-prop-finesse: **Finesse** or :weapon-prop-thrown: **Thrown** property use different rules. Spells requiring an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** use the caster's spellcasting ability.
- **Proficiency Bonus:** Add this when attacking with a weapon you're proficient with or when casting a spell attack. You don't add Proficiency Bonus to damage rolls inless stated otherwise.

### Rolling 1 or 20

- **Critical Hit:** Rolling a 20 means the attack hits and deals double damage.
- **Automatic Miss:** Rolling a 1 means the attack misses.

## Unseen Attackers and Targets

Attacking a target you can't see gives you :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**. If the target isn't where you guessed, you automatically miss. Attacking a creature that can't see you gives you advantage. If you are hidden, your location is revealed when you attack.

## Ranged Attacks

### Range

You can only make ranged attacks within the specified range. Some weapons have two ranges: normal and long. Attacking beyond the normal range but within the long range gives you :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**.

### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Making a ranged attack within 5 ft. of a hostile creature gives you :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**.

## Melee Attacks

Melee attacks are made within your reach, typically 5 ft. Certain creatures have a longer reach. Instead of using a weapon, you can make an **Unarmed Strike**

### Unarmed Strike

An Unarmed Strike is a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within your Reach. 

Your bonus to hit with an Unarmed Strike equals your Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, your Unarmed Strike causes one of the following effects of your choice: 

- **Damage.** The target takes :dmg-bludgeoning: **Bludgeoning** Damage equal to **1 + your Strength modifier**.
- **Grappled.**  The target is **Grappled**, and the grappleâ€™s escape DC equals **8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus**. Possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab the target.
- **Shove.** You either push the target 5 ft. away or knock the target **Prone**. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you.

### Opportunity Attacks

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature moves out of your reach. Use your :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. Disengaging, teleporting, or being moved without using your movement, action, or :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** doesn't provoke an opportunity attack.
