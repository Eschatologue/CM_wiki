## Movement

*Main article: [Movement](movement.md)*

You can move up to your :rsc-movement: **Movement** speed on your turn. You can break up your movement before and after actions.

- **Movement Speed:** Determined by your race, class, and any conditions affecting you.
- **Difficult Terrain:** Moving through difficult terrain (e.g., thick underbrush, rubble) costs double the movement.
- **Climbing, Swimming, Crawling:** These types of movement also typically cost extra movement, usually double.

??? tip "Flying Movement"

    Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the *fly* spell.

### Interacting with Objects

During your turn, you can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free. Examples include:

- Drawing or sheathing a sword.
- Opening a door.
- Picking up a small item.
- Withdraw a potion from your backpack
- Pick up a dropped axe
- Take a bauble from a table
- Hand an item to another character
- and so on

If you want to interact with more than one object, you may need to use your action.
