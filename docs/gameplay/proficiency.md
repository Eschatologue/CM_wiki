# Proficiency

Characters and monster are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can only use a few. Some are better at understanding people motives, and other ate better at understanding the secrets of the world. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels. A monster Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (CR). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined,

This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a :d20-save: Saving Throw, or a with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The Bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculationg the DC of saving throws spells.

## The Bonus Doesn't Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once.

Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided before being added. For example, the Expertise feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for a certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied onlt once and diviced onle once.

??? question "Constitution :d20-check: **Ability Check**"

    Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.

All characters gain Proficiency in multiple skills depending on their chosen background during character creation, and can choose 2-4 more skills to be proficient in from a list of skills determined by their class.

Additionally, some races, subclasses, and feats also give Proficiency in specific skills, and bards receive the class feature Jack of All Trades at level 2, allowing them to add half their Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to :d20-check: **Ability Checks** they make using skills they are not proficient in.

Proficiency does not stack â€“ there's no benefit to having multiple sources of Proficiency for a skill.
