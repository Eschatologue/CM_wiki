# Inventory

In this campaign, inventories are managed differently than in your typical D&D game where items have weight (ain't nobody got time for that). Instead, for the sake of convenience, inventory is calculated using slots, similar to some video games.

## Carrying Capacity

--8<-- "docs/glossary.md:carrying-capacity"

## Additional Spaces

Additional Spaces are specialised inventory slots for your character. These slots can only hold specific types of items or equipment, and anything stored in these spaces does not count towards your total Inventory Slots.

### Worn

Any item worn by your character, such as Armour, clothing, Necklaces, Rings, etc., does not take up Inventory Slots.

### Equipped

You have 4 spaces on your person for usable items, such as Weapons, Shields, or Quivers. Items in these spaces does not take up Inventory Slots.

### Backpack

You have 1 space designated for a backpack. A backpack increases your available Inventory Slots by the amount it provides.
