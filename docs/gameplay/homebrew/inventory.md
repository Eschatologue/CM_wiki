# Inventory Slots

## Introduction

In this campaign, inventories are managed differently than in your typical D&D game where items have weight (ain’t nobody got time for that). Instead, for the sake of convenience, inventory is calculated using slots, similar to some video games.

## Inventory Slots

Inventory slots are the units of measurement for how many items you can carry. Items are categorized by their general size and weight and can take up different amounts of slots.

**Inventory Slots Count:** You have an amount of inventory slots equal to your :ability-str: **Strength** score. For example, if you have a :ability-str: **Strength** score of 17, you have 17 slots.

## Extra Inventories

Extra inventories are additional slots that do not count against your main inventory slots.

### Equipped

You have 4 extra inventory slots on your person that can hold usable items, such as weapons, shields, and quivers. Items in these extra slots do not take up inventory slots.

### Worn

Any item worn on the person, such as armor, clothing, or simple accessories like necklaces or rings, does not take up slots.

## Inventory Items

### Ammunition Storing Equipment

Items such as crossbow bolt cases or quivers can store up to 20 bolts or arrows.

### Backpacks

At the start of the game, depending on the starting gear chosen from your class, you receive a Backpack. This Backpack takes 1 inventory slot but adds up to `+8` inventory slots for your character. You can only carry and use one backpack at a time, and you can't put a backpack inside another backpack. This isn't Minecraft, and you don't have shulker boxes.

Taking an item from a backpack requires an :dnd-rsc-action: **Action**, representing the time it takes to search for and retrieve an item. As such, you can't use an item that is inside your backpack until you have used an :dnd-rsc-action: **Action** to pull it out.

Larger backpacks exist in this D&D that you can find.

### The Mysterious Black Chest

A mysterious item conjured by the will of the DM and blessed by the God of DM’s Convenience. This chest appears whenever the DM feels like it and can seemingly store an infinite number of items.

## Item Size Categories

An item's "Bulk" does not necessarily represent its weight. It might be light but cumbersome or small but very heavy. Regardless, refer to the rules below for item categorization.

### Stackable

Can fit **ten per slot** of the same item type. This includes small items such as arrows, bolts, and rations. Items such as ball bearings can even stack up to 1000 before taking an inventory slot.

### Light

Equipment with the *light* property does not take an inventory slot until a **stack of three** is completed. For example, two shortswords do not take an inventory slot, but two shortswords and a dagger will take 1 inventory slot.

### Medium
Takes up **one slots**. Normally most items you would fine would fall into this category. 

### Heavy or Two-handed

Takes up **two slots** per item. These are items with the *heavy* or *two-handed* property. A greatsword will take two inventory slots due to the *heavy* property, and so will a halberd due to its *heavy* and *two-handed* properties.

### Heavy Armour

Takes up **three slots**, including heavy armour and tower shields when they are not in the Equipped or Worn slots.
