# Inventory

In this campaign, inventories are managed differently than in your typical D&D game where items have weight (ain’t nobody got time for that). Instead, for the sake of convenience, inventory is calculated using slots, similar to some video games.

## Inventory Slots

Inventory slots are the units of measurement for how many items you can carry. Items are categorized by their general size and weight and can take up different amounts of slots.

**Inventory Slots Count**  
You have an amount of inventory slots equal to your :ability-str:**Strength** score. For example, if you have a :ability-str:**Strength** score of 17, you have 17 slots.

## Extra Inventories

Extra inventories are additional slots that do not count against your main inventory slots.

### Equipped

You have 4 extra inventory slots on your person that can hold usable items, such as weapons, shields, and quivers. Items in these extra slots do not take up inventory slots.

### Worn

Any item worn on the person, such as armour, clothing, or simple accessories like necklaces or rings, does not take up slots.

## Inventory Items

### Ammunition Storing Equipment

Items such as crossbow bolt cases or quivers can store up to 20 bolts or arrows.

### Backpacks

At the start of the game, depending on the starting gear chosen from your class, you receive a Backpack. 

This Backpack takes 1 inventory slot but adds up to +8 inventory slots for your character.

For a list of Backpacks and its mechanic, go to [here](../../equipment/tools/backpack.md).

**Retreiving Item.** Taking an item from a backpack requires an :rsc-action:**Action**, representing the time it takes to search for and retrieve an item. As such, you can't use an item that is inside your backpack until you have used an :rsc-action:**Action** to pull it out.

### The Mysterious Black Chest

A mysterious item conjured by the will of the DM and powered by the DM’s Convenience. This chest appears whenever the DM feels like it and can seemingly store an infinite number of items.

## Item Size Categories

An item's "Bulk" does not necessarily represent its weight. It might be light but cumbersome or small but very heavy. Refer to the rules below for item categorization.

### Stackable

Small items that can be stacked together without taking up multiple inventory slots. 

You can fit **up to ten** of the same item type per slot. Certain items, like ball bearings, can stack up to 1000 before taking up an inventory slot.

*Examples are Arrows, Bolts, Rations, ball bearings.*

### Light

Items that are easy to carry and do not take up much space individually. 

Equipment with the *light* property **does not take an inventory slot** until you have a **stack of three**. For example, two shortswords do not take an inventory slot, but two shortswords with a dagger will take 1 inventory slot.

*Examples are Daggers, potions, small tools.*

### Medium

Standard-sized items that require some space in your inventory, this category ecompass most item you will come across.

These items take up **one inventory slot** each.

*Examples are longswords, shields, spellbooks.*

### Heavy or Two-handed

Large or cumbersome items that require significant space to carry. 

Items with the *heavy* or *two-handed* property take up **two inventory slots** each.  

*Examples are greatswords, halberds, mauls.*

### Heavy Armour

Bulky protective gear that takes up considerable space when not worn. 

These items take up **three inventory slots** each when they are not in the Equipped or Worn slots.

*Examples are plate armour, chainmail, tower shields.*
