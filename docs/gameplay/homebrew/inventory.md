In this campaign, inventories are calculated differently than your normal DnD where item has weight (ainâ€™t nobody got time for it). Therefore, for the sake of convenience, inventory are calculated like slots like some games. 

## Inventory Slots Calculation

Your carrying/inventory slot is calculated as follow:

| **INVENTORY SLOTS**|
|:-:|
|:material-arm-flex:{ .lg }**Strength** Score + :material-bag-personal-plus:{ .lg }**Backpack** + Other Bonuses (If applicapble)|

## Backpacks

At the start of the game, depending on what starting gear you have choosen from your class, you would get a Backpack. This Backpacks adds up to +5 inventory slots for your character.
