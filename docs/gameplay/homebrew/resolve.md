!!! example "Experimental"

    You just stumbled into an **Experimental** mechanic! This game material made by me, and is heavily inspired by Darkest Dungeon 1 and Darkest Dungeon 2. For now, only for use by the DM and will occur within a number of encounters to make combat more exiting.

# Resolve

*“If death won’t get you, the madness will.” — Common saying in Antares*

The wilderness of Antares may seem calm, but beneath its stillness lie horrors that tear at both flesh and mind. **Resolve** represents a creature’s ability to endure trauma — not just physical, but mental. This optional mechanic introduces a layer of psychological pressure to high-stakes encounters. It is typically applied to enemies, but the DM may choose to use it for players as well.

## Resolve Save

A **Resolve Save** is triggered when a creature undergoes extreme physical or mental trauma. These saves represent moments when instinct or willpower might override pain — or when the mind begins to fracture under pressure.

### When to Make a Resolve Save

**Massive Damage**

:   When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than **half its hit point maximum**, it must succeed on a **:abl-int::d20-save: Intelligence**{.nowrap}, **:abl-wis::d20-save: Wisdom**{.nowrap}, or **:abl-cha::d20-save: Charisma**{.nowrap} saving throw (the creature chooses which).

    On a success, nothing happens and the fight continues.

    On a failure, see [Failing a Resolve Save](#failing-resolve-save).

**Reduced to 0 Hit Points**

:   When a creature is reduced to **0 hit points**, it may choose to make a **Resolve Save** in a desperate attempt to stay conscious.
  
    On a success, the creature immediately gains **:trt-hp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to **10% of its maximum hit points** (rounded down). It must then **immediately roll on the Resolve Result Table**.

    These temporary hit points last for **1 minute** or until depleted.

> **Special Case**: If a creature takes **Massive Damage that also reduces it to 0 hit points**, only the **higher DC** is used.

**Resolve Save DC = 10** or **half the damage taken** (rounded down), whichever is higher (maximum 25)

## Failing Resolve Save

On a **failed Resolve Save**, the creature must roll on the **Resolve Result Table**.
The table contains a variety of effects — most negative, some severe, and a rare few beneficial. These results reflect how the creature’s mind or body responds under catastrophic stress: panic, hallucinations, trauma, instinctual rage, or clarity in the face of death.

##### Resolve Result

| d12 | Name | Effect |
|:-:|---|---|
| 1 | Fatal | The creature drops to 0 Hit Points. |
