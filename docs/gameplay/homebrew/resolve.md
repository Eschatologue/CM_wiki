!!! example "Experimental"

    You just stumbled into an **Experimental** mechanic! This game material made by me, and is heavily inspired by Darkest Dungeon 1 and Darkest Dungeon 2. For now, only for use by the DM and will occur within a number of encounters to make combat more exiting.

# Resolve

> *“If death doesn't take you, something else will.”

**Resolve** is a measure of how a creature reacts when pushed beyond its limits - mentally, physically, or emotionally. When a creature endures overwhelming trauma, it must roll on the **Resolve Result Table**, representing a sudden mental fracture, instinctual response, or psychosomatic effect.

## When to Roll

A creature must immediately roll on the **Resolve Result Table** whenever it:

**Receive Massive Damage**

:   Takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than **half its hit point maximum**, *or,*

**Reduced to 0 Hit Points**

:   Once per **:rest-long: Long Rest**, when a creature is reduced to **0 Hit points**, it may choose to roll on the **Resolve Result table** instead of falling Unconscious and making death saving throws. If it does so, it immediately gains 1 Hit Point and the creature roll in the **Resolve Result table** as normal

**Special Case**{.inl} If a creature takes massive damage **and** is reduced to 0 hit points at the same time, it rolls **only once**.

## Resolve Result

When a creature is required to roll on the **Resolve Result Table**, it gains a random effect that reflects its physical or mental response to extreme trauma. Most outcomes are negative or debilitating, though some are beneficial — rare moments of clarity, adrenaline, or grim resolve.

Resolve result persist until the creature finishes a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

**Duplicate Results**{.inl} If a creature rolls a result it already has, it imediately ends the current result.

**Resolve Effects as Conditions**{.inl} Effects gained from the Resolve Result Table are treated as Conditions for the purpose of spells, abilities, and other game mechanics that references conditions with the exception of **Collapses**, **Moment of Denial**, and **Barely Standing**
