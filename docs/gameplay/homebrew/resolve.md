!!! example "Experimental"

    You just stumbled into an **Experimental** mechanic! This game material made by me, and is heavily inspired by Darkest Dungeon 1 and Darkest Dungeon 2. For now, only for use by the DM and will occur within a number of encounters to make combat more exiting.

## Resolve

> *“If death doesn’t take you, something else will.”

**Resolve** is a measure of how a creature reacts when pushed beyond its limits — mentally, physically, or emotionally. When a creature endures overwhelming trauma, it must roll on the **Resolve Result Table**, representing a sudden mental fracture, instinctual response, or psychosomatic effect.

## When to Roll

A creature must immediately roll on the **Resolve Result Table** whenever it:

**Receive Massive Damage**

:   Takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than **half its hit point maximum**

*or,*

**Reduced to 0 HP**

:   The creature is reduced to **0 hit points**

> **Special Case**: If a creature takes massive damage **and** is reduced to 0 hit points at the same time, it rolls **only once**.
