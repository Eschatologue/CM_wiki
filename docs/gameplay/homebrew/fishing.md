!!! homebrew "This is a Homebrew Mechanic!"

    You just stumbled into a Homebrew mechanic! This minigame is orginally designed by Saffy Penrose, and its system is used as a base for this D&D Fishing mechanic.

# Fishing and Angling

In the days before the devastation caused by the warp storms and the emergence of horrendous aberrations in the Antares wilderness, fishing was a cherished pastime. Commoners, adventurers, and even nobility took delight in casting their lines into the serene waters. However, as most civilizations withdrew behind the protective walls of citadel cities, the art of fishing slowly slipped into obscurity.

Antares' natural rivers and waters, now severely tainted by the Warp, saw most of its fish population undergo mutations, giving them grotesque features akin to the aberrations roaming the land. While many former fishermen and anglers turned to fish farming to preserve the dwindling population of untainted fish, a few individuals remained steadfast in their love for the excitement and adrenaline that only fishing could provide. 

## Fishing Equipment

*A great fisherman is not just lucky, but also prepared.*  
{ .quote }

To start fishing, you need the [Fishing Supplies] tool. This is a box equipped with compartments for baits, tackles, an external compartment for your fishing rod, and other essential items for fishing, regardless of its appearance. It contains the aforementioned items, all of which are necessary to begin fishing. These items are discussed in the following sections:

### Baits  

*Don't dip yer' hand there—fish go crazy over that.*  
{ .quote }  

Baits are used to attract fish. While it’s possible to fish without bait, the likelihood of catching something other than fish increases significantly. Baits are consumed when used and can only be equipped on fishing rods with a bait slot.  

The Bait table lists commonly available baits for purchase at most establishments. Special baits may exist but are subject to the DM's discretion.  

| Bait | Effect | Cost |
|---|---|--:|
| Bait | Adds +3 bonus to Fishing Roll, *after* multiplier | 10 SP | 
| Deluxe Bait | Adds +6 bonus to Fishing Roll, *after* multiplier | 100 SP | 
| Exotic Bait | Adds +12 bonus to Fishing Roll, *after* multiplier | 400 SP | 
| Master Bait | Adds +24 bonus to Fishing Roll, *after* multiplier | 1,200 SP |
| Wild Bait | After Fishing Roll's final result is calculated, roll a d8. On 7 or 8, you get two Fish instead of one | 150 SP |

### Tackles

Tackles

### Fishing Rods

The Fishing Rods table below lists various fishing rods along with their associated costs and features. Each rod includes the following details:  

**Bait Slot**{ .inl } A fishing rod can be equipped with bait to attract fish. Some baits provide flat bonuses, while others may increase the number of fish caught.  

**Tackle Slot**{ .inl } A fishing rod can be equipped with specific tackles to modify its functionality.  

##### Fishing Rods  

| Rods | bait slot | tackle slot | cost |
|---|:-:|:-:|--|
| Crude Angler's Rod | 0 | 0 | - |
| Novice Angler's Rod | 1 | 0 | 700 SP |
| Journeymen Angler's Rod | 1 | 1 | 1,400 SP |
| Adept Angler's Rod | 1 | 2 | 2,800 SP |
| Master Angler's Rod | 2 | 2 | 5,600 SP |

## Step by Step

### 1. Finding a Body of Water

Most fish live in bodies of water, so you can only fish in a location capable of supporting aquatic life. No, you can’t fish in a glass of water, a well, a puddle on the road, etc.

### 2. Rolling Dice

You can attempt to fish up to 3 times within the span of 1 hour. For each fishing attempt, roll five :die-d6: d6s. You may reroll dice based on the rules outlined in the Fishing Die Reroll table, as explained below:

**Proficiency**{ .inl } This column specifies the proficiency required for rerolls.

**Reroll Count**{ .inl } This indicates the number of rerolls available based on the corresponding proficiency. You may reroll the same die more than once. After rerolling, final results for each die must be kept.

##### Fishing Die Reroll

| Proficiency | Reroll Count |
|:--|:-:|
| Fishing Supplies | + Equals to Proficiency Bonus |
| Wisdom (Survival) | + Equals to Wisdom Modifier |
| Intelligence (Arcana) | + Equals to Intelligence Modifier |

These reroll counts are **additive**. If you meet multiple proficiency prerequisites, add the reroll counts together to determine your total number you can reroll.

### Calculating Final Result

Before summing your results, check if you rolled a special result. Multiply your sum by the corresponding modifier in the special result table. Sum all the dice you rolled, then multiply the total by the appropriate multiplier from the table. The final result is ^^rounded up^^. You can only benefit from one special result.

##### Special Result Table

| Special Result | Multiplier | Description | Example |
|---|:-:|---|:-:|
| Three-of-a-kind | ×2 | Three dice of the same number. | `5 5 5 2 4` |
| Full House | ×2.5 | Three dice of one number and two of another. | `3 3 3 5 5` |
| Straight | ×3 | Five sequential numbers. | `5 4 3 2 1` |
| Four-of-a-kind | ×4 | Four dice of the same number. | `2 2 2 2 4` |
| Five-of-a-kind | ×5 | Five dice of the same number. | `6 6 6 6 6` |

!!! tip "Dice Maiden"

    It is understandable that this can be complicated when using Dice Maiden in Discord; rerolling dice in particular can be difficult to track. An alternate solution is to use the dice roll provided by [Google](https://g.co/kgs/yktfMZF). You can easily click the dice you wish to reroll with this.  
    ~~Please don't fumble your rolls~~

## Fishing Loot

### Fishing Loot Table

Below is the Fishing table for each different biome you can fish within Antares. Refer to the table after calculating your final result:

## Example: Fishing with Antagoni

Let's walk through a fishing example with our beloved special character, the legendary fishermen: Antagoni.

1. **Prepare to Fish**{ .inl } 
Antagoni decides to go fishing. He spends some time preparing his gear, attaching the bait and tackle, and finding a good spot. Fishing will take at least 1 hour.

2. **Roll the Dice**{ .inl } 
Antagoni is ready to fish for 1 hour. He rolls 5d6 to determine his catch. His rolls are: `4, 6, 6, 6, 2`.

3. **Check for Proficiency and Reroll**{ .inl } 
Antagoni has Proficiency in Wisdom (Survival) with a Wisdom score modifier of +2, skil. This allows him to reroll up to 2 dice. He chooses to reroll the 2 dice showing 4 and 2. His new rolls are 6 and 3. Now his dice results are: `6, 6, 6, 6, 3`.

4. **Calculate Special Results**{ .inl } 
Antagoni checks if he has a special result. He rolled a Four-of-a-kind (four 6s), which has a multiplier of ×4.

5. **Calculate Final Result**{ .inl } 
Antagoni sums his dice results: `6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 27`.

He then multiplies the sum by the Four-of-a-kind multiplier (×4): `27 × 4 = 108`.

**Determine the Catch**{ .inl } 
Antagoni consults the fishing table to determine what he caught based on the final result of 108, for this example purpose; A magical longsword. The specifics of the catch would depend on the fishing table.
