In the days before the devastation caused by the warp storms and the emergence of itâ€™s horrendous aberrations in the Antares wilderness, fishing was a cherished pastime. Commoners, adventurers, and even nobility took delight in casting their lines into the serene waters. However, as most civilizations withdrew behind the protective walls of citadel cities, the art of fishing slowly slipped into obscurity.

Antares' natural rivers and waters, now severely tainted by the Warp, saw most of its fish population undergo mutations, giving them grotesque features akin to the aberrations roaming the land. While many former fishermen and anglers turned to fish farming, attempting to preserve the dwindling population of untainted fish, a few individuals remained steadfast in their love for the excitement and adrenaline that only fishing could provide. 

Though most fishes had become inedible due to their mutations, some of the brightest minds in Antares recognized their potential. Mostly spearheaded by Karakorum, they saw beyond the grotesque exterior and delved into the Essence of these creatures. Through alchemical processes, arcane rituals, and ingenious engineering, they use these mutated aquatic life into some of the most powerful magical trinkets, weapon enhancements, and crucial technological developments ever known to the realm.
