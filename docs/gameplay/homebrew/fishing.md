!!! homebrew "This is a Homebrew Mechanic!"

    You just stumbled into a Homebrew mechanic! This minigame is orginally designed by Saffy Penrose, and its system is used as a base for this D&D Fishing mechanic.

In the days before the devastation caused by the warp storms and the emergence of it’s horrendous aberrations in the Antares wilderness, fishing was a cherished pastime. Commoners, adventurers, and even nobility took delight in casting their lines into the serene waters. However, as most civilizations withdrew behind the protective walls of citadel cities, the art of fishing slowly slipped into obscurity.

Antares' natural rivers and waters, now severely tainted by the Warp, saw most of its fish population undergo mutations, giving them grotesque features akin to the aberrations roaming the land. While many former fishermen and anglers turned to fish farming, attempting to preserve the dwindling population of untainted fish, a few individuals remained steadfast in their love for the excitement and adrenaline that only fishing could provide. 

## It's Fishin' Time

This newly designed fishing mechanic is completely different from what you might remember in the previous version, so just forget that previous version and refer to this version from now on.

**Time.** Fishing takes time, from preparing your gear, attaching the bait and tackles, luring the rod, and of course! Waitng. Each fishing attempt will take at least **1 hour**.

## How to Fish

**Rolling Dice.** For every 1 hour you spent fishing, roll :material-dice-d8: 5d8. If you have proficiency either in Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Arcana), you can reroll a number of time equal to your Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Arcana) modifier respectively, if you have both of the skill proficiency, only the highest modifier instance will be accounted for. Otherwise, you can reroll a number of die equal to either your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier, only the highest modifier instance will be accounted for. You can reroll the same dice more than once. Afterwhich, keep each die result.

**Calculating Final Result.** Before you sum your result, take a look if you rolled a special result, you may choose to multiply your sum by the corresponding modifier in the special result table. Sum all the dice you rolled then multiply the total with what multipler corresponding to said table. Then consult the table to determine what you caught.
