!!! homebrew "This is a Homebrew Mechanic!"

    You just stumbled into a Homebrew mechanic! This minigame is orginally designed by Saffy Penrose, and its system is used as a base for this D&D Fishing mechanic.

# Fishing and Angling

In the days before the devastation caused by the warp storms and the emergence of horrendous aberrations in the Antares wilderness, fishing was a cherished pastime. Commoners, adventurers, and even nobility took delight in casting their lines into the serene waters. However, as most civilizations withdrew behind the protective walls of citadel cities, the art of fishing slowly slipped into obscurity.

Antares' natural rivers and waters, now severely tainted by the Warp, saw most of its fish population undergo mutations, giving them grotesque features akin to the aberrations roaming the land. While many former fishermen and anglers turned to fish farming to preserve the dwindling population of untainted fish, a few individuals remained steadfast in their love for the excitement and adrenaline that only fishing could provide. 

## Fishing Equipment  

*A great fisherman is not just lucky, but also prepared.*  
{ .quote }  

To start fishing, you need the [Fishing Supplies] tool. This is a box equipped with compartments for baits, tackles, an external compartment for your fishing rod, and other essential items for fishing, regardless of its appearance. It contains all the necessary items to begin fishing.  

For inventory management purposes, as long as you have [Fishing Supplies], all your bait, tackles, and fishing rods occupy the same inventory slot as the [Fishing Supplies]. Think of it like a quiver, but for fishing gear instead of arrows.  

These items are discussed in the following sections:  

### Baits  

*"Don't dip yer' hand there—fish go crazy over that."*  
{ .quote }  

Baits are used to attract fish. While it’s possible to fish without bait, the likelihood of catching something other than fish increases significantly. Baits are consumed when used and can only be equipped on fishing rods with a bait slot.  

The Bait table outlines commonly available baits for purchase at most establishments.

##### Bait

<div class="grid" markdown>

| Common Bait | Effect | Cost |
|---|---|--:|
| *Bait* | Adds +3 bonus to Overall Score | 50 SP | 
| *Deluxe Bait* | Adds +6 bonus to Overall Score | 150 SP | 
| *Exotic Bait* | Adds +12 bonus to Overall Score | 500 SP | 
| *Master Bait* | Adds +24 bonus to Overall Score | 1,200 SP |

| Special Bait | Effect | Cost |
|---|---|--:|
| *Arcane Bait* | *See Fishing Appendix A* | 300 SP |
| *Gambler's Bait* | *See Fishing Appendix A* | 500 SP | 
| *Target Bait* | *See Fishing Appendix A* | 250 SP | 
| *Wild Bait* | *See Fishing Appendix A* | 250 SP | 

</div>

### Tackle

*"A clever angler knows: the right tackle makes all the difference."*
{ .quote }

Tackles enhance the functionality of your fishing rod. While baits improve the **Overall Score** or allow you to target specific fish, tackles modify the mechanics of fishing itself. Each tackle has a unique functionality, as outlined in the Tackles table.

##### Tackles

| Tackle | Effects | Cost |
|---|---|--:|
| *Spinner* | You can reroll 1 extra dice when fishing | 800 SP |
| *Dressed Spinner* | You can reroll 2 extra dice when fishing | 1,600 SP |
| *Adjustable Hook* | When determing loot from the Fishing Loot table, you can change your loot into one that is in the one row above or below | 2,500 SP |
| *Multi-hook* | When determing your loot from the Fishing Loot table, you get one more loot determined from your Overall Score minus 30 | 2,500 SP |
| *Lead Float* | Change all your Fishing Dices from :die-d6: d6s into :die-d8: d8s |
| *Foam Float* | Change all your Fishing Dices from :die-d6: d6s into :die-d4: d4s |

### Fishing Rods

The Fishing Rods table below lists various fishing rods along with their associated costs and features. Each rod includes the following details:  

**Bait Slot**{ .inl } A fishing rod can be equipped with bait to attract fish. Some baits provide flat bonuses, while others may increase the number of fish caught.  

**Tackle Slot**{ .inl } A fishing rod can be equipped with specific tackles to modify its functionality.  

##### Fishing Rods  

| Rods | bait slot | tackle slot | cost |
|---|:-:|:-:|--:|
| *Crude Angler's Rod* | - | - | - |
| *Novice Angler's Rod* | 1 | - | 700 SP |
| *Journeymen Angler's Rod* | 1 | 1 | 1,400 SP |
| *Adept Angler's Rod* | 1 | 2 | 3,200 SP |
| *Master Angler's Rod* | 2 | 2 | 6,800 SP |

## How to Fish

### Step 1: Find a Body of Water  

Most fish live in bodies of water, so you can only fish in a location capable of supporting aquatic life. No, you can’t fish in a glass of water, a well, a puddle on the road, or similar places.  

### Step 2: Rolling Dice  

During 1 hour of fishing, you can attempt up to 3 fishing rolls. For each attempt, roll **five :die-d6: d6s**. You may reroll dice up to a number of times equal to your Wisdom (Survival) modifier.  

- You may reroll the same die multiple times.  
- After all rerolls, keep the final results for each die.  

### Step 3: Calculating Overall Score  

Before summing your results, check if you rolled a **special result**. Add up all the dice you rolled, then multiply the total by the appropriate multiplier from the table below. The final score is **rounded up**. You can only benefit from one special result per roll.  

##### Special Result Table  

| Special Result | Multiplier | Description | Example |
|---|:-:|---|:-:|
| *Three-of-a-kind* | ×2 | Three dice of the same number. | `5 5 5 2 4` |
| *Straight* | ×3 | Five sequential numbers. | `5 4 3 2 1` |
| *Four-of-a-kind* | ×4 | Four dice of the same number. | `2 2 2 2 4` |
| *Five-of-a-kind* | ×5 | Five dice of the same number. | `6 6 6 6 6` |

!!! tip "Dice Maiden"  

    Using Dice Maiden on Discord can make rerolling and tracking results challenging. As an alternative, try using [Google's Dice Roller](https://g.co/kgs/yktfMZF). This tool lets you easily select the dice you want to reroll.  
    ~~Please don't fumble your rolls~~  

### Step 4: Determine Loot

After obtaining your final result from Step 3, compare the number to the relevant fishing table. This section includes four tables, each corresponding to a specific biome where you can fish.

If an effect—such as from baits or other modifiers—adds to or subtracts from your Overall Score, apply these adjustments **after Step 3** (i.e., after all multipliers have been calculated), unless the effect specifies otherwise.
