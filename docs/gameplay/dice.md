# Dice

Dices are the core mechanics of D&D. In every situation, dice are rolled to determine the outcome of a myriad of situations, such as whether or not a character will succeed at using a particular skill, if an attack will land and how much damage it will do, and even when the DM feels like adding a little unpredictability.

## Dice Notation

D&D uses the d20 system—a role-playing game system published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast, originally developed for the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Though the name is d20, it often includes other dice notations as well—usually notated with a `d` followed by the number of sides on that specific die.

:die-d4:{ .lg .middle } `d4` - :die-d6:{ .lg .middle } `d6` - :die-d8:{ .lg .middle } `d8` - :die-d10:{ .lg .middle } `d10` - :die-d12:{ .lg .middle } `d12` - :die-d20:{ .lg .middle } `d20`

The number of dice to be rolled is notated immediately before the `d`. Any applicable modifiers for the roll are given as an addition (if it is a bonus) or subtraction (if it is a penalty) after the dice notation. When a single twenty-sided die (d20) is rolled with no modifiers, it is notated as `1d20`. When two six-sided dice (d6) are rolled with a modifier of +3, the roll is notated as `2d6+3`.

### Percentile Dice

The rules sometimes refer to a d100. While such dice exist, the common way to roll a 1d100 is to use a pair of ten-sided dice numbered from 1 to 9, known as a **Percentile Dice**. One die–that you designate before rolling–gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 for the tens digit and a 1 for the ones digit, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.

Some then-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100

### D3

The same d notation appears in the expresion "1d3", even though it's rare to find dice with oly three sides. To simulate rolling 1d3, roll a 1d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up).

### Digital Dice Rollers

While physical dice are often a staple in tabletop gaming, they can also be expensive and not always practical, especially when playing online. Digital dice rollers offer a convenient and accessible alternative, allowing players to easily roll dice in virtual environments.

One of the key benefits of using a digital dice roller is visibility—everyone can see the results in real-time, ensuring transparency and preventing any accidental misunderstandings during gameplay. Additionally, digital rollers can handle irregular dice such as **d3**, **d100**, or other custom rolls that may not be readily available in physical sets, offering more flexibility to the game.

For those playing online or looking for cost-effective alternatives, I recommend using either the **[Dice Maiden](https://top.gg/bot/377701707943116800)** bot on Discord or the dice roller provided by **[Google](https://g.co/kgs/rc9i8qP)**. Both options provide a quick and easy way to roll dice and keep your game moving smoothly.

## What Are Dice For?

Here are the most common uses of dice in D&D.

### D20 Tests

In D&D, the twenty-sided die (:die-d20: d20) is central to the game's mechanics, determining the success or failure of a wide range of actions. Whenever a creature attempts an action with a chance of failure, it rolls a d20 and adds any applicable modifiers. The result is compared to a target number to see if the attempt succeeds.

The term d20 Test encompasses the three main d20 rolls of the game: :d20-attack: **Attack Rolls** – which are rolled against the target's **Armour Class** (**AC**), :d20-check:**Ability Check** – which are rolled against the check's Difficulty Class (DC), and :d20-save:**Saving Throws** – which are rolled against a save DC.

### Damage

The most common use for dice other than the d20 is to determine damage. When you make a succesful Attack Roll, you roll damage to see how effective the attack is. When you cast a spell, you might also roll damage. Different weapons and spells use different dice for damage. For example, a dagger uses 1d4, a Greataxe uses 1d12, and a Fireball spell uses 8d6.
