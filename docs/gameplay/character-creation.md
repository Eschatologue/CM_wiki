This D&D campaign setting uses the same rulings as what you would find in other settings with minor additions and modifications. On a notable note, it uses combinations of 5th Edition ruling and OneD&D ruling.

## Starting Stats
In this setting, we uses the Standard Array as follow: `15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8`

Simply assign one number to each ability score (one to Strength, one to Dexterity, one to Constitution, and so on). Then, you'll be able to determine your character's modifier for each score.

### Ability Scores
*Main Article: [Ability Score](/docs/gameplay/playing-the-game.md#ability-scores-and-modifiers)*

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.
