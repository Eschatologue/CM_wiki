## Action Types

Actions are the acts taken by creatures on their turns. Actions are generally taken in order to deal damage or inflict harmful conditions, but they can also be taken to heal or aid allies.

A special form of action – known as a :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** – can be used as a response to certain triggers, including on the turns of other creatures.

Taking actions usually requires the acting creature to expend one of three resources:

|:rsc-action:{ .xxl .middle }|:rsc-bonus-action:{ .xxl .middle }|:rsc-reaction:{ .xxl .middle }|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**ACTION**|**BONUS ACTION**|**REACTION**|

### :rsc-action:{ .lg .pad-r } Action

An Action is a primary activity that a creature can perform during their turn. This encompasses a wide range of activities such as attacking, casting a spell, or using an item. Typically, creatures can perform one Action per turn.

**Example**:

  - **Attack**: A fighter swings their sword at an enemy, making a melee attack.
  - **Cast a Spell**: A wizard casts the spell "Fireball," targeting a group of enemies.
  - **Dash**: A paladies their action to move double their movement speed to close in upon the enemies.

### :rsc-bonus-action:{ .lg .pad-r } Bonus Action

Some actions, frequently referred to as *:rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**s*, require a Bonus Action to be expended when taken.

A Bonus Action is a secondary action that certain abilities, spells, or class features allow a creature to perform in addition to their main :rsc-action: **Action**. Not all characters or actions can use a Bonus Action, and creatures can typically perform only one :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** per turn if they have an ability that grants them one.

**Example**:

  - **Two-Weapon Fighting**: A ranger attacks with their main weapon using their :rsc-action: **Action**, then uses their :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to make an off-hand attack with a second weapon.
  - **Misty Step**: A warlock uses their :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to cast this spell, teleporting 30 feet to a spot they can see.

### :rsc-reaction:{ .lg .pad-r } Reaction

A :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** is an :rsc-action: **Action** that creatures can take in response to a specific event, even if it’s not their turn. Creatures can typically take only one :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** per round. Reactions often have specific triggers, such as an enemy's movement or an attack.

**Example**:

- **Opportunity Attack**: When an enemy leaves a fighter's reach, the fighter uses their :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to make a melee attack against the enemy.
- **Shield**: A wizard casts this spell as a :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to being hit by an attack, gaining a +5 bonus to their AC potentially causing the attack to miss.
- **Counterspell**: A sorcerer uses their :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to counter a spell being cast by an enemy within 60 feet.
- **Uncanny Dodge**: A rogue uses their :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to halve the damage from an attack that hits them.

## Spell Slots

|:rsc-spell-slot:{ .xxl .middle }|
|:-:|
|**SPELL SLOT**|

Spell slots are a resource used by spellcasting characters to cast their spells. They represent the number and power level of spells that a character can cast in a day. Spell slots are specific to each spellcasting class, and the number and levels of :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** available increase as a character gains levels in that particular class.

### Basic Concept

:rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** determine how many spells of different levels a character can cast before needing to rest. Each spellcasting class has a table that shows how many :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** of each level the character has at each class level. For example, a 5th-level wizard might have four 1st-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**, three 2nd-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**, and two 3rd-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**, while a 5th-level cleric might have a different arrangement of :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**.

### Using Spell Slots

As per new One D&D rules, ^^on a turn, you can expend only one spell slot^^ to cast a spell. This rule means you can't for example, cast a spell by expending spell slot from a class feature as an :rsc-action: **Action** and another one using a :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** on the same turn. 

!!! tip "Spell Slot-less Spells"

  If you have the abilty to cast a spell without expending a spell slot (Warlock's Mystic Arcanum or Star Druid Guiding Bolts), you can cast those spell and can still cast another spell by expending a spell slot. All other rules of spellcasting still apply. 

To cast a spell, a character must expend a :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** of the spell's level or higher. Each spellcasting class's :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** are unique to that class. For instance, a character cannot use a druid :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** to cast a wizard spell when multiclassing. To cast a spell, the character must use a :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** available to the class from which the spell originates.

This restriction does not apply to Warlock :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**. A warlock :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** can be used to cast a spell from any class even if that spell does not belong to the warlock class, provided that the character know and can cast the spell. Does not work in reverse however, you can't cast a warlock spell using a wizard :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot**.

### Recovery of Spell Slots

Most spellcasters regain all their :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** after completing a Long Rest (typically 8 hours of rest). Some classes, like the Warlock, have features that allow them to recover :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** more frequently, such as during a Short Rest (about 1 hour).

**Examples:**

- **A Level 3 Wizard:** A 3rd-level wizard might have four 1st-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** and two 2nd-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**. They can cast six spells before needing to rest, using only the :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** available to them as a wizard class.
- **Using a Higher-Level Slot:** A cleric might cast "Cure Wounds," which is a 1st-level spell, using a 3rd-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** to heal for more Hit Points. Instead of the base healing amount, the spell heals additional Hit Points per each level above the 1st, using only the cleric's :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots**.

### Spell Slot Table

Each spellcasting class has a table that shows the number of :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** available at each level. This table is crucial for players to track how many spells they can cast before needing to rest. The table varies from class to class, reflecting the different spellcasting abilities of wizards, clerics, sorcerers, and other spellcasters.

### Flexible Casting

Higher-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slots** can be used to cast lower-level spells, often with enhanced effects. For example, casting the spell "Magic Missile" using a 2nd-level :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** instead of a 1st-level slot grants additional missiles.

## Movement

|:rsc-speed:{ .xxl .middle }|
|:-:|
| **MOVEMENT** |

Movement determines how far creatures can travel on their turn during combat or an adventure. Each character has a movement speed, usually measured in feet, indicating the distance they can cover under normal circumstances.

### Basic Movement

Each character’s movement speed is listed in their race description. For example, most humans have a movement speed of 30 feet, while dwarves typically have a :rsc-speed: **Speed** of 25 feet. On their turn, creatures can move a distance up to their movement speed. This movement can be broken up before and after taking an :rsc-action: **Action**, :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**, or :rsc-reaction: **Reaction**.

### Difficult Terrain

Moving through difficult terrain, such as thick underbrush or shallow water, costs double movement. For example, moving 1 foot through difficult terrain costs 2 feet of movement. This reduces the distance creatures can travel in such conditions.

### Alternative Movement Types

Characters can also have alternative movement types such as climbing, swimming, or flying. These are often granted by spells, items, or special abilities and may have different speeds and restrictions compared to regular movement. For example, creatures with a climbing speed can move up vertical surfaces more easily than those without.

**Examples:**

- **Basic Movement:** A human fighter with a movement speed of 30 feet can move up to 30 feet on their turn. They might move 15 feet, attack an enemy, and then move another 15 feet.
- **Difficult Terrain:** A dwarf cleric with a movement speed of 25 feet moves through a swamp, which is difficult terrain. Each foot of movement costs 2 feet, so they can only move 12 feet (rounded down) in one turn.
- **Climbing and Swimming:** An elf ranger has a base movement speed of 35 feet. If they start climbing a tree (assuming no special climbing speed), they move at half speed, so they can climb 17 feet in one turn. If the ranger has a spell or ability granting them a climbing speed of 30 feet, they can climb up to 30 feet in one turn.

### Dash

Creatures can take the Dash action to double their movement speed for the turn. For example, a rogue with a movement speed of 30 feet uses Dash and can move 60 feet.

### Jumping

Characters can jump a certain distance based on their Strength score. A long jump covers a distance equal to the character’s Strength score if they get a 10-foot running start, and a high jump reaches 3 + the character’s Strength modifier feet off the ground.

### Standing Up from Prone

Standing up from a prone position costs half of the character's movement speed. For example, a human with 30 feet of movement speed uses 15 feet of it to stand up from prone, leaving them with 15 feet of movement remaining.

### Combining Movement with Actions

Characters can combine movement with actions in any order. For example, creatures can move 10 feet, cast a spell, then move another 20 feet. Properly managing movement can help creatures position themselves advantageously, avoid hazards, and engage or evade enemies effectively.

### Opportunity Attacks

Moving out of an enemy’s reach typically provokes an opportunity attack, allowing the enemy to use their :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to make a melee attack. This makes careful planning of movement crucial during combat to avoid unnecessary damage.

## Hit Dice

|:rsc-hitdie:{ .xxl .middle }|
|:-:|
|**HIT DICE**|

Hit Dice are an essential mechanic in D&D that represent a character's ability to recover health during Short Rests and determine their overall Hit Points.

### Determining Hit Dice

Each class in D&D has a specific type of Hit Die. For example, a Fighter uses a d10, while a Wizard uses a d6. This reflects the class's general durability and health.

- **Number of Hit Dice:** A character has a number of Hit Dice equal to their level in a particular class. For instance, a 5th-level Rogue (who uses a d8) has five d8 Hit Dice.

### Using Hit Dice

Hit Dice are primarily used to recover Hit Points during a Short Rest:

- **Short Rest Recovery:** During a Short Rest (typically 1 hour), a character can spend one or more of their Hit Dice to regain Hit Points. The player rolls the Hit Die, adds the character's Constitution modifier to the result, and regains that many Hit Points. Multiple Hit Dice can be rolled if desired.
    - **Example:** A 4th-level Fighter (d10 Hit Dice) with a +2 Constitution modifier can spend one of their Hit Dice during a Short Rest. They roll a d10, get a 6, add their +2 modifier for a total of 8 Hit Points recovered. They have three remaining Hit Dice for that day.
- **Regaining Hit Dice:** After a Long Rest (typically 8 hours), a character regains spent Hit Dice up to a number equal to half their total Hit Dice (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, they regain four after a Long Rest.

??? info "Other Uses of Hit Dice"

    Some class features and abilities may require or allow the use of Hit Dice for special effects. Always refer to the specific class description for details.

### Hit Dice and Hit Points

Hit Dice also play a role in determining a character's maximum Hit Points:

- **Leveling Up:** When a character gains a level, they roll the Hit Die associated with their class, add their Constitution modifier, and increase their maximum Hit Points by that amount.
    - **Example:** When a 2nd-level Wizard (d6 Hit Dice) levels up to 3rd level and has a +1 Constitution modifier, they roll a d6, get a 4, add their +1 modifier, and increase their maximum Hit Points by 5.

Understanding and effectively using Hit Dice can significantly impact a character's survivability and overall performance in a campaign. Use them wisely during rests to maintain your health and be prepared for the challenges ahead.
