## Action Types

Actions are the acts taken by creatures on their turns. Actions are generally taken in order to deal damage or inflict harmful conditions, but they can also be taken to heal or aid allies.

A special form of action – known as a reaction – can be used as a response to certain triggers, including on the turns of other creatures.

Taking actions usually requires the acting creature to expend one of three resources:

:   :material-circle: **Action** - :material-triangle: **Bonus Action** - :material-star-four-points: **Reaction**

### :material-circle: Actions

An Action is a primary activity that a creature can perform during their turn. This encompasses a wide range of activities such as attacking, casting a spell, or using an item. Typically, creatures can perform one Action per turn.

**Example**:

  - **Attack**: A fighter swings their sword at an enemy, making a melee attack.
  - **Cast a Spell**: A wizard casts the spell "Fireball," targeting a group of enemies.
  - **Dash**: A paladin uses their action to move double their movement speed to close in upon the enemies.

### :material-triangle: Bonus Actions
Some actions, frequently referred to as *bonus actions*, require a Bonus Action to be expended when taken.

A Bonus Action is a secondary action that certain abilities, spells, or class features allow a creature to perform in addition to their main **Action**. Not all characters or actions can use a Bonus Action, and creatures can typically perform only one **Bonus Action** per turn if they have an ability that grants them one.

**Example**:

  - **Two-Weapon Fighting**: A ranger attacks with their main weapon using their **Action**, then uses their **Bonus Action** to make an off-hand attack with a second weapon.
  - **Misty Step**: A warlock uses their **Bonus Action** to cast this spell, teleporting 30 feet to a spot they can see.

### :material-star-four-points: Reactions

A **Reaction** is an action that creatures can take in response to a specific event, even if it’s not their turn. Creatures can typically take only one **Reaction** per round. Reactions often have specific triggers, such as an enemy's movement or an attack.

**Example**:

- **Opportunity Attack**: When an enemy leaves a fighter's reach, the fighter uses their **Reaction** to make a melee attack against the enemy.
- **Shield**: A wizard casts this spell as a **Reaction** to being hit by an attack, gaining a +5 bonus to their AC potentially causing the attack to miss.
- **Counterspell**: A sorcerer uses their **Reaction** to counter a spell being cast by an enemy within 60 feet.
- **Uncanny Dodge**: A rogue uses their **Reaction** to halve the damage from an attack that hits them.

## Spell Slots

Spell slots are a resource used by spellcasting characters to cast their spells. They represent the number and power level of spells that a character can cast in a day. Spell slots are specific to each spellcasting class, and the number and levels of spell slots available increase as a character gains levels in that particular class.

### Basic Concept

Spell slots determine how many spells of different levels a character can cast before needing to rest. Each spellcasting class has a table that shows how many spell slots of each level the character has at each class level. For example, a 5th-level wizard might have four 1st-level spell slots, three 2nd-level spell slots, and two 3rd-level spell slots, while a 5th-level cleric might have a different arrangement of spell slots.

### Using Spell Slots

To cast a spell, a character must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. Each spellcasting class's spell slots are unique to that class. For instance, a character cannot use a druid spell slot to cast a wizard spell when multiclassing. To cast a spell, the character must use a spell slot available to the class from which the spell originates.

    This restriction does not apply to Warlock spell slots. A warlock spell slot can be used to cast a spell from any class even if that spell does not belong to the warlock class, provided that the character know and can cast the spell. Does not work in reverse however, you can't cast a warlock spell using a wizard spell slot.

### Recovery of Spell Slots

Most spellcasters regain all their spell slots after completing a long rest (typically 8 hours of rest). Some classes, like the Warlock, have features that allow them to recover spell slots more frequently, such as during a short rest (about 1 hour).

**Examples:**

- **A Level 3 Wizard:** A 3rd-level wizard might have four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level spell slots. They can cast six spells before needing to rest, using only the spell slots available to them as a wizard class.
- **Using a Higher-Level Slot:** A cleric might cast "Cure Wounds," which is a 1st-level spell, using a 3rd-level spell slot to heal for more hit points. Instead of the base healing amount, the spell heals additional hit points per each level above the 1st, using only the cleric's spell slots.

### Spell Slot Table

Each spellcasting class has a table that shows the number of spell slots available at each level. This table is crucial for players to track how many spells they can cast before needing to rest. The table varies from class to class, reflecting the different spellcasting abilities of wizards, clerics, sorcerers, and other spellcasters.

### Flexible Casting

Higher-level spell slots can be used to cast lower-level spells, often with enhanced effects. For example, casting the spell "Magic Missile" using a 2nd-level spell slot instead of a 1st-level slot grants additional missiles.

## Movement

Movement determines how far creatures can travel on their turn during combat or an adventure. Each character has a movement speed, usually measured in feet, indicating the distance they can cover under normal circumstances.

### Basic Movement

Each character’s movement speed is listed in their race description. For example, most humans have a movement speed of 30 feet, while dwarves typically have a movement speed of 25 feet. On their turn, creatures can move a distance up to their movement speed. This movement can be broken up before and after taking an action, bonus action, or reaction.

### Difficult Terrain

Moving through difficult terrain, such as thick underbrush or shallow water, costs double movement. For example, moving 1 foot through difficult terrain costs 2 feet of movement. This reduces the distance creatures can travel in such conditions.

### Alternative Movement Types

Characters can also have alternative movement types such as climbing, swimming, or flying. These are often granted by spells, items, or special abilities and may have different speeds and restrictions compared to regular movement. For example, creatures with a climbing speed can move up vertical surfaces more easily than those without.

**Examples:**

- **Basic Movement:** A human fighter with a movement speed of 30 feet can move up to 30 feet on their turn. They might move 15 feet, attack an enemy, and then move another 15 feet.
- **Difficult Terrain:** A dwarf cleric with a movement speed of 25 feet moves through a swamp, which is difficult terrain. Each foot of movement costs 2 feet, so they can only move 12 feet (rounded down) in one turn.
- **Climbing and Swimming:** An elf ranger has a base movement speed of 35 feet. If they start climbing a tree (assuming no special climbing speed), they move at half speed, so they can climb 17 feet in one turn. If the ranger has a spell or ability granting them a climbing speed of 30 feet, they can climb up to 30 feet in one turn.

### Dash Action

Creatures can take the Dash action to double their movement speed for the turn. For example, a rogue with a movement speed of 30 feet uses Dash and can move 60 feet.

### Jumping

Characters can jump a certain distance based on their Strength score. A long jump covers a distance equal to the character’s Strength score if they get a 10-foot running start, and a high jump reaches 3 + the character’s Strength modifier feet off the ground.

### Standing Up from Prone

Standing up from a prone position costs half of the character's movement speed. For example, a human with 30 feet of movement speed uses 15 feet of it to stand up from prone, leaving them with 15 feet of movement remaining.

### Combining Movement with Actions

Characters can combine movement with actions in any order. For example, creatures can move 10 feet, cast a spell, then move another 20 feet. Properly managing movement can help creatures position themselves advantageously, avoid hazards, and engage or evade enemies effectively.

### Opportunity Attacks

Moving out of an enemy’s reach typically provokes an opportunity attack, allowing the enemy to use their reaction to make a melee attack. This makes careful planning of movement crucial during combat to avoid unnecessary damage.
