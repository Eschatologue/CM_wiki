# Combat

Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat often breaks out.

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash betweer two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **Round** reoresents about 6 seconds in the game world.

During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn, The order of turns is determined at the beginning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side is defeated.

### Combat Step by Step

Combat unfolds in these steps:

1. **Establish Position**  
The DM determines where all the characters and monster are located. Given the adventurers marching order or their stated position in the room or other location, the DM figures out where adversaries are–how far away, and what dicrection.

2. **Roll Initiative**  
Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiativem determining the order of combatants' turns.

3. **Take Turns**  
Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat this step until fighting stops.

### Initiative

> *"Roll for Initiative!"*

Initiative determines the order in which characters and creatures act during combat in Dungeons & Dragons. Intitiative is made with a :d20-check: Dexterity **Ability Check**. The DM rolls for monsters. For a group of indentical creatures, the DM makes a singe roll, so each member of the group has the same Initiative.

#### Surprise

If a combatant is suprised by combat starting, that combatant has :d20-disadv: Disadvantage on their Initiative roll, this is relevant during ambushes.

#### Initiative Order

&emsp; **Turn Order.** The DM organizes all participants from highest to lowest initiative roll. This order dictates who acts first, second, and so on, throughout each round of combat.

&emsp; **Tie-Breakers.** If two or more participants have the same initiative roll, the participant with the higher Dexterity score goes first.

### Your Turn

During your turn, you can do the following on any order:

- Move up to your :rsc-speed: **Speed**
- Take one :rsc-action: **Action**
- Take one :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** (If you have a feature that uses it)

#### Communicating

You can communicate however you are able–through bried uttarances and gestures–as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither your :rsc-action: nor your move.

Extended communications, such as detailes explanation of something or an attempt to persuade a foe, requies an action. The **Influence** action is the main way you try to influence a monster.

#### Interacting with Things

You can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during either your move as you stride toward a foe.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to take the **Utilise** action. Some magic items and other special object always requires an action to use, as stted in their descriptions.

#### Doing Nothing

You can forgo moving, takking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do, consider taking the defensive **Dodge** action or the **Ready** action to delay acting.

### Ending Combat

Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, which can mean the creatures are killed or koncked out, or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also end when both sides agree to end it.
