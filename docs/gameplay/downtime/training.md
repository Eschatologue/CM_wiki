# Downtime Activity: Training

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language, pick up a proficiency.

## Resources

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 250 SP per workweek.

## Complications

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.

##### Training Complications

| d6 | Complication |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | Your instructor disappears, forcing you to spend one workweek finding a new one.* |
| 2 | Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. |
| 3 | Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.* |
| 4 | Your teacher is a wanted criminal. |
| 5 | Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster. |
| 6 | Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat. |

## Training to Gain Levels

As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend downtime training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a character has earned enough experience points to attain a new level, he or she must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the new level.

The training time required depends on the level to be gained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. The training cost is for the total training time.

##### Training to Gain Levels

| Level Attained | Training Time | Training Cost |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2nd-4th | 10 days | 200 SP |
| 5th-10th | 20 days | 400 SP |
| 11th-16th | 30 days | 600 SP |
| 17th-20th | 40 days | 800 SP |
