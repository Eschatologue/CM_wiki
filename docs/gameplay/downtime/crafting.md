# Downtime Activity: Crafting

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armour, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

## Resources and Resolution

In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its SP cost by 500. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 500 SP or lower. Items that cost more than 500 SP can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Per DM discretion, many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

## Crafting Magic Items

Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

Potions of healing and spell scrolls are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see "[Brewing Potions of Healing](#brewing-potions-of-healing)" later in this section and the "[Scribing a Spell Scroll](scribing-scroll.md)" section, later.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

##### Magic Item Ingredients

| Item Rarity | CR Range
|---|:-:|
| Common | 1–3 |
| Uncommon | 4–8 | 
| Rare | 9–12 | 
| Very rare | 13–18 | 
| Legendary | 19+ | 

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. 

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

##### Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

| Item Rarity | Workweeks* | Cost* |
|---|:-:|--:|
| Common | 1 | 50 SP |
| Uncommon | 2 | 200 SP |
| Rare | 10 | 2,000 SP |
| Very rare | 25 | 20,000 SP |
| Legendary | 50 | 100,000 SP |

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

## Complications

Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

##### Crafting Complications

| d6 | Complication |
|:-:|---|
| 1 | Rumors swirl that what you're working on is unstable and a threat to the community.* |
| 2 | Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.* |
| 3 | A local wizard shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you. |
| 4 | A powerful noble offers a hefty price for your work and is not interested in hearing no for an answer.* |
| 5 | A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secret lore to fuel your work.* |
| 6 | A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.* |

*Might involve a [rival]

## Brewing Potions of Healing

[Potions of Healing](../../equipment/consumeables/potion.md#healing-potion) fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the [herbalism kit] can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

##### Potion of Healing Creation

| Type | Time | Cost |
|:--|---|--:|
| Healing | 1 day | 250 SP |
| Greater healing | 1 workweek | 1000 SP |
| Superior healing | 3 workweeks | 10,000 SP |
| Supreme healing | 4 workweeks | 100,000 SP |
