!!! homebrew "This is a Homebrew Mechanic!"

    You just stumbled into a Homebrew mechanic! This minigame is orginally designed by Saffy Penrose, and its system is used as a base for this D&D Fishing mechanic.

# Fishing and Angling

In the days before the devastation caused by the warp storms and the emergence of horrendous aberrations in the Antares wilderness, fishing was a cherished pastime. Commoners, adventurers, and even nobility took delight in casting their lines into the serene waters. However, as most civilizations withdrew behind the protective walls of citadel cities, the art of fishing slowly slipped into obscurity.

Antares' natural rivers and waters, now severely tainted by the Warp, saw most of its fish population undergo mutations, giving them grotesque features akin to the aberrations roaming the land. While many former fishermen and anglers turned to fish farming to preserve the dwindling population of untainted fish, a few individuals remained steadfast in their love for the excitement and adrenaline that only fishing could provide. 

### Update from Previous Version

- **Different Baits:** Baits are no longer required to fish. Instead, having [Fishing Supplies] is now necessary as they contain your fishing equipment, including your baits. Specially made baits do exist, but they act more similarly to magical or special ammunition for ranged weapons.

- **D20 Wisdom (Survival) Checks:** You can fish wherever you see water without needing to make a Survival check. However, if you attempt to fish in an obscure place, such as a well, a puddle in a cave, or someone's drinking water, the DM will require a Wisdom check. Proficiency with [Fishing Supplies] allows you to add your Proficiency Bonus to this check.

- **Aberrant and Untainted Fish:** These categorizations no longer exist. Instead, each fish has been adjusted in price to reflect its rarity.

## Resources

This newly designed fishing mechanic is completely different from what you might remember in the previous version. Forget the old rules and refer to this version from now on.

**Time.**{ .inl } Fishing takes time. From preparing your gear, attaching the bait and tackles, luring the rod, and of course, waiting. Each fishing attempt will take at least **1 hour**.

**Equipment.**{ .inl } To fish you need two things; A Fishing Rod and a Fishing supplies. A Fishing Rod is required to reel in your fish while Fishing supplies contains various items to such as bait, hook, lines etc to help said fishing.

## Resolution

### Rolling Dice

For every 1 hour you spend fishing, roll five :die-d6: d6s. The process varies slightly depending on your skills:

- **Proficiency in [Fishing Supplies]:** You can reroll a number of dice up to your Wisdom modifier.
- **Proficiency in Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Arcana):** You can reroll a number of dice up to your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier.
- **Proficiency in both [Fishing Supplies] and either Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Arcana):** You can reroll a number of dice equal to your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

You can reroll the same die more than once. After rerolling, keep each final die result.

### Calculating Final Result

Before summing your results, check if you rolled a special result. Multiply your sum by the corresponding modifier in the special result table. Sum all the dice you rolled, then multiply the total by the appropriate multiplier from the table. The final result is ^^rounded up^^. You can only benefit from one special result.

##### Special Result Table

| Special Result | Multiplier | Description | Example |
|---|:-:|---|:-:|
| Three-of-a-kind | ×2 | Three dice of the same number. | `5 5 5 2 4` |
| Full House | ×2.5 | Three dice of one number and two of another. | `3 3 3 5 5` |
| Straight | ×3 | Five sequential numbers. | `5 4 3 2 1` |
| Four-of-a-kind | ×4 | Four dice of the same number. | `2 2 2 2 4` |
| Five-of-a-kind | ×5 | Five dice of the same number. | `6 6 6 6 6` |

!!! tip "Dice Maiden"

    It is understandable that this can be complicated when using Dice Maiden in Discord; rerolling dice in particular can be difficult to track. An alternate solution is to use the dice roll provided by [Google](https://g.co/kgs/yktfMZF). You can easily click the dice you wish to reroll with this.  
    ~~Please don't fumble your rolls~~

## Fishing Equipment

A great fishermen is not just that is lucky, but those who both lucky and came prepared. This part right here defines some fishing equipment that you can come across in the world. These equipemnt can help you get better result when pulling something from the depths.

### Fishing Rods

| Rods | overall score bonus | mod.slot | cost |
| --- | :-: | --: | --: |
| Crude Angler's Rod | - | 1 slot | — |
| Novice Angler's Rod | +2 | 2 slot | 700 SP |
| Journeymen Angler's Rod | +4 | 3 slot | 1,400 SP |
| Adept Angler's Rod | +6 | 4 slot | 2,800 SP |
| Master Angler's Rod | +8 | 6 slot | 5,600 SP |

**Overall Score Bonus:** Each fishing rod provides a score bonus to determine what loot you pull from the depths. This score bonus is added after any additional multiplier.

**Mod. Slot:** Each fishing rod can be modified and tinkered to the fisherman's desire. To equip a [modification], you must have a slot available. Some [modification]s can take multiple slots.

[modification]: #fishing-rod-modifications

### Fishing Supplies

[Fishing Supplies] are categorized as a Tool. They include a special compartment or clip for your fishing rod, a tackle box with simple line, hooks, bait, bobbers, and lures. Regardless of their appearance, you need this tool and your fishing rod to start fishing.

### Fishing Rod Modifications

!!! warning "Work in Progress"

Fishing rod modifications are augmentations that enhance your fishing rod to yield better results. These modifications work similarly to the Artificer Infusion mechanic, being tied to whichever fishing rod you modify. To modify your fishing rod, you must be proficient with [Fishing Supplies].

You can change your fishing rod modifications as part of a **:rest-short: Short Rest** or before a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

## Example: Fishing with Antagoni

Let's walk through a fishing example with our beloved special character, the legendary fishermen: Antagoni.

1. **Prepare to Fish**{ .inl } 
Antagoni decides to go fishing. He spends some time preparing his gear, attaching the bait and tackle, and finding a good spot. Fishing will take at least 1 hour.

2. **Roll the Dice**{ .inl } 
Antagoni is ready to fish for 1 hour. He rolls 5d6 to determine his catch. His rolls are: `4, 6, 6, 6, 2`.

3. **Check for Proficiency and Reroll**{ .inl } 
Antagoni has Proficiency in Wisdom (Survival) with a Wisdom score modifier of +2, skil. This allows him to reroll up to 2 dice. He chooses to reroll the 2 dice showing 4 and 2. His new rolls are 6 and 3. Now his dice results are: `6, 6, 6, 6, 3`.

4. **Calculate Special Results**{ .inl } 
Antagoni checks if he has a special result. He rolled a Four-of-a-kind (four 6s), which has a multiplier of ×4.

5. **Calculate Final Result**{ .inl } 
Antagoni sums his dice results: `6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 27`.

He then multiplies the sum by the Four-of-a-kind multiplier (×4): `27 × 4 = 108`.

**Determine the Catch**{ .inl } 
Antagoni consults the fishing table to determine what he caught based on the final result of 108, for this example purpose; A magical longsword. The specifics of the catch would depend on the fishing table.
