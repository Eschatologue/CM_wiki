# Action

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an :rsc-a: **Action**. The Action table lists the game's main actions, which are defined more detail here.

##### Actions

| Action | Summary | 
|---|---|
| **Attack** | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike |
| **Dash** | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed |
| **Disengage** | Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attack for the rest of the turn | 
| **Dodge** | Until the start of your next turn, Attack Rolls against you have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**, and you make Dexterity saving throw with :d20-adv: **Advantage**. You lost this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0 |
| **Help** | Help another creature Ability Check or Attack Roll, or administer first aid |
| **Hide** | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check | 
| **Influence** | Make Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Perfomance, or Persuassion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature's attitude |
| **Magic** | Cast a Spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature |
| **Ready** | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define |
| **Search**| Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check |
| **Study** | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, or Survival) check | 
| **Utilise** | Use nonmagical object |

Player characters and monster can also do things not covered by these actuibs, Many ckass features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you wheter that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.

## One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. **You can take only one action at a time**. This principle is most important in Combat.

Actions can come up in other situations too: In a social interactions, you can try to Influence a creature or use the Search action to read the creature's body language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who's trying to open a stuck door (with Utilise action)

## Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**. The Cunning Action feature for a Rogue, allows it to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action **only** when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don't have a Bonus Action to take.

You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action's timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of the ability to take Actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.

## Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow yout ake special actions called a :rsc-r: **Reaction**. A **Reaction** is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someeone else's. The :rsc-r: Opportunity Attack is the most common type of **Reactions**.

When you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, tjat creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction.

In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediatelt after its trigger unless the Reaction's description says otherwise.

## Action Lists

Below is the list of all actions you could take

---

### Attack

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

The most common action to take in combat is the **Attack** action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. This action often requires you to make an attack roll against the target's AC.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

---

### Cast a Spell

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action, :rsc-b: Bonus Action, or :rsc-r: Reaction

Spellcasters such as Wizards and Clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. 

Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. 

Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of Action, so a spellcaster often uses their action in combat to cast such a spell. 

---

### Dash

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the **Dash** action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

---

### Disengage

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

If you take the **Disengage** action, your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

---

### Dodge

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the **Dodge** action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw**s with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.

---

### End Concentration

**Cost:** None

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

---

### Help

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the **Help** action, you do one of the following:

***Assist Ability Check.*** Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who can perceive you. You give Advantage to the next ability check that ally makes with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. To give this assistance, you must be near enough to the ally to assist verbally or physically when the ally makes the check. The DM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.

***Assist Attack Roll.*** You momentarily distract an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to the next attack roll by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.

---

### Hide 

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so stealthily, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you're Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any visible enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition. Make note of your check's total, which becomes the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurrences: 

- You make a sound louder than a whisper 
- An enemy finds you, you make an attack roll
- You cast a spell with a verbal component.

---

### Identify a Spell

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action or :rsc-r: Reaction

A character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.

If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.

This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.

---

### Magic

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the Magic action, you magic something by casting a spell that has a casting time of an :rsc-a: Action or by using a feature or Magic Item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.

---

### Opportunity Attack

**Cost:** :rsc-r: Reaction

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an Opportunity Attack.

You can make an **Opportunity Attack** when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the Opportunity Attack, you use your :rsc-r: **Reaction** to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.

Opportunity Attack is also often referred to as 'Attack of Opportunity', they are both the same.

---

### Ready

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

You take the **Ready** action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a :rsc-r: **Reaction** before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your Speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

***Readying a Spell.*** When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your :rsc-r: **Reaction** when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires Concentration, which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

---

### Search 

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what you're trying to detect.

##### Search

| Skill | Thing to Detect |
|---|---|
| Insight | Creature's state of mind |
| Medicine | Creature's ailment |
| Perception | Concealed creature or object |
| Survival |  Tracks or food |

---

### Study

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a creature, a clue, an object, or another source of
knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.

The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on the area of knowledge the Intelligence check is about.

##### Areas of Knowledge

| Skills | Areas |
|---|---|
| Arcana | Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities) |
| History | Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids) |
| Investigation | Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry |
| Nature | Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and Plants) |
| Religion | Deities, religious hierarchies and rites, holy symbols, cults, and certain creatures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead) |

---

### Unarmed Strike

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect.

***Damage***

: You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes :dmg-blunt: Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.

***Grapple*** 

: The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.

***Shove***

: The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.

### Utilise

**Cost:** :rsc-a: Action

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of the Attack action. When an object requires an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.
