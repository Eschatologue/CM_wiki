# Actions

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. They are acts taken by creatures on their turns. Actions are generally taken in order to deal damage, cast spells, make ability checks or inflict harmful conditions, but they can also be taken to heal or aid allies.

## One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. **You can take only one action at a time**. This principle is most important in Combat.

Actions can come up in other situations too: In a social interactions, you can try to **:rsc-a: Influence**{ .rsc } a creature or use the Search action to read the creature's body language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneously use the Search action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who's trying to open a stuck door (with Utilise action)

## Resources

For a creature to perform an action, particularly in combat scenarios, it must expend one of three resources. These resources allow a creature to perform various activities such as attacking, casting spells, or using special features. The three primary resources are:

**:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc } – **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } – **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }
{ .align-center }

### :rsc-a: Action

An **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc } is one of the three primary resources that a creature can expend during its turn. Actions like **Attack**{ .rsc }, **Dash**{ .rsc },  **Magic**{ .rsc }, or **Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } typically require an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }. 

You can **only** use an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc } for activities that explicitly require one. If an activity requires an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }, no other resources (**:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } or **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }) can be used for that activity.

### :rsc-b: Bonus Action

A **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } is an additional action a creature can take during its turn, granted by certain class features, spells, or other abilities. 

You can only take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } if a specific feature, spell, or ability states that it requires one. Otherwise, you do not have a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to use.

The **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } can be taken at any point during your turn unless its timing is specifically stated. If something prevents you from taking an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }, it also prevents you from taking a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }.

### :rsc-r: Reaction

A **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } is a special action that occurs in response to a specific trigger, which can happen either on your turn or on another creature's turn. The most common type of **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } is the **Opportunity Attack**{ .em }.

Once you take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }, you cannot take another **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } until the start of your next turn. If the **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn immediately after it has been completed.

In terms of timing, a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } occurs immediately after its trigger, unless the specific description of the **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } states otherwise.

## Action Lists

Below is a list of common actions you can take, along with relevant details:

**Cost:** Each action requires using one of your available resources—**:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }, **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, or **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }. To perform a specific action, you must have the appropriate resource available. For example, you cannot take the **Attack**{ .rsc } action (which requires an Action) if you have already used your Action to take the Dash action.

:   ### Attack :rsc-a:

    The most common action to take in combat is the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make ^^one^^ melee or ranged attack. This action often requires you to make an **:d20-attack: Attack Roll** against the target's **AC**.

    Certain features, such as the **Extra Attack** feature of the Fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

**:action-dash:{.x3l}**

:   ### Dash :rsc-a:

    When you take the **Dash**{ .rsc } action, you gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em }, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash.

    Any increase or decrease to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

**:material-arrange-send-to-back:{.x3l}

:   ### Disengage :rsc-a:

    If you take the **:rsc-a: Disengage**{ .rsc } action, your Movement doesn't provoke **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**{.rsc} for the rest of the turn.

:material-arrow-expand:{.x3l}

:   ### Dodge :rsc-a:

    When you take the **Dodge**{ .rsc } action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } if you can see the attacker, and you make **:d20-save: DEX Save**{ .d20 } with **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 }. You lose this benefit if you have the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition or if your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } is 0.

:material-handshake:{.x3l}

:   ### Help :rsc-a:

    When you take the **Help**{ .rsc } action, you do one of the following:

    **Assist Ability Check**{ .inl } Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who can perceive you. You give **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } to the next ability check that ally makes with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. To give this assistance, you must be near enough to the ally to assist verbally or physically when the ally makes the check. The DM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.

    **Assist Attack Roll**{ .inl } You momentarily distract an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } to the next attack roll by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.

---

:action-hide:{.x3l}

:   ### Hide :rsc-a:

    With the **Hide**{ .rsc } action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so stealthily, you must succeed on a :d20-check: DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you're Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any visible enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

    On a successful check, you have the **Invisible**{.cond} condition. Make note of your check's total, which becomes the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

    The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurrences: 

    - You make a sound louder than a whisper 
    - An enemy finds you, you make an attack roll
    - You cast a spell with a verbal component.

:material-translate-variant:{.x3l}

:   ### Influence

    With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you're communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The DM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below.

    ***Willing.*** If your urging aligns with the monster's desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.

    ***Unwilling.*** If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn't comply.

    ***Hesitant.*** If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster's attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you're interacting with the monster. The DM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster's Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the same way again.

    ##### Influence Checks
    | Ability Check | Interaction |
    |---|---|
    | Charisma (Deception) | Deceiving a monster that understands you |
    | Charisma (Intimidation) | Intimidating a monster |
    | Charisma (Performance) | Amusing a monster |
    | Charisma (Persuasion) | Persuading a monster that understands you |
    | Wisdom (Animal Handling) | Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity |

:   ### Magic :rsc-a:

    When you take the **Magic**{ .rsc } action, you magic something by casting a spell that has a casting time of an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc } or by using a feature or Magic Item that requires a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action to be activated.

    If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.

:material-sword-cross:{ .x3l }

:   ### Opportunity Attack :rsc-r:

    In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an **Opportunity Attack** (also often referred to as 'Attack of Opportunity').

    You can make an **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attack**{ .em } when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the Opportunity Attack, you use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's Movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.

---

### Ready

**Cost:** **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }

You take the **Ready**{ .rsc } action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

**Readying a Spell**{ .inl } When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires Concentration, which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

### Search 

**Cost:** **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }

When you take the **Search**{ .rsc } action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what you're trying to detect.

##### Search

| Skill | Thing to Detect |
|---|---|
| Insight | Creature's state of mind |
| Medicine | Creature's ailment |
| Perception | Concealed creature or object |
| Survival |  Tracks or food |

---

### Study

**Cost:** **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }

When you take the **Study**{ .rsc} action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a creature, a clue, an object, or another source of
knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.

The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on the area of knowledge the Intelligence check is about.

##### Areas of Knowledge

| Skills | Areas |
|---|---|
| Arcana | Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities) |
| History | Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids) |
| Investigation | Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry |
| Nature | Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and Plants) |
| Religion | Deities, religious hierarchies and rites, holy symbols, cults, and certain creatures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead) |

### Unarmed Strike

**Cost:** **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an **Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } , choose one of the following options for its effect.

#### Damage

You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.

#### Grapple

The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.

#### Shove

The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.

### Utilise

**Cost:** **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action. When an object requires an action for its use, you take the Utilise action.
