# Proficiency

Characters and monster are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can only use a few. Some are better at understanding people motives, and other ate better at understanding the secrets of the world. All creatures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature's capabilities. A character's Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels. A monster Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating (CR). The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined,

This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a :d20-save: Saving Throw, or a with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The Bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculationg the DC of saving throws spells.

##### Proficiency bonus

| Level or CR | Bonus | | Level or CR | Bonus |
|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|:-:|
| Up to 4 | +2 | | 17-20 | +6 |
| 5-8 | +3 | | 21-24 | +7 |
| 9-12 | +4 | | 25-28 | +8 |
| 13-16| +5 | | 29-30 | +9 |

## The Bonus Doesn't Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can't be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example. if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuassion) check, you add Proficiency Bonus if you're proficient in either skill, but you don't add it twice if you're proficient in both skills.

Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided before being added. For example, the Expertise feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for a certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied onlt once and diviced onle once.

## Skill Proficiencies

Most ability checks involve using a skill, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an ability check. The descriptions of the actions you take specify which skill applies if you make an ability check for that action, and many other rules note when a skill is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.

If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks involving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a creature can still make ability checks involving that skill but doesn't add its Proficiency Bonus. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.

??? question "Constitution :d20-check: **Ability Check**"

    Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.
