# Dexterity

Dexterity is an Ability Score and a key ability of Rogues, Rangers, Monks, and other wielders of weapon with :weapon-prop-finesse: **Finesse** property.

Dexterity affects your Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills, as well as your attack rolls for ranged weapons and :weapon-prop-finesse: **Finesse** weapons. It also affects your Initiative and Armour Class.

## Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

### Acrobatics 

Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

### Sleight of Hand 

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.

### Stealth 

Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

## Uses of Dexterity

### Attack rolls and Damage

Creatures add their Dexterity modifier to the results of attack and damage rolls of ranged weapons and, and the creature's can choose between their Dexterity score or Strength score for melee weapons with the :weapon-prop-finesse: **Finesse** property.

### Armour Class

Creatures also add their Dexterity modifier to their Armour Class (AC) - making them more difficult to hit, up to a maximum of +2 when wearing most medium armour. The bonus is ignored when wearing heavy armour, unless otherwise specified.

### Hiding
 
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.
 
You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
 
In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .em } on an attack roll before you are seen.
 
??? info "Passive Perception"

    When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.
 
    For example, if a 1st-level character (with a Proficiency Bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and a Proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.
