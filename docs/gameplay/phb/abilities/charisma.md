# Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others and forcing your will upon reality. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.

Charisma is the recommended primary ability and spellcasting ability for :class-phb24-bard: Bards, :class-phb24-sorcerer: Sorcerers, :class-phb24-warlock: Warlocks and :class-phb24-paladin: Paladins.

## Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.

### Deception

Determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your :rsc-action: **Actions**. 

This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. 

Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

### Performance

Determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

### Persuasion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. 

Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

    The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    - Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
    - Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

## Uses of Charisma

### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the :d20-save: **Saving Throw** DCs of spells they cast.

### Charisma saves

A charisma save is made against anything that you resist by sheer will rather than simply being aware of its unreality.
