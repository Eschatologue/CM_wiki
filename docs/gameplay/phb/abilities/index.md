## Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monster have a score as high as 30, The score represents the magnitute of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarises what the score mean.

##### Ability Scores
|Score|Meaning|
|:-:|---|
| 1 | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens.
| 2-9 | This represents a weak capability. |
| 10-11 | This represents the human average. |
| 12-19 | This represents a strong capability. |
| 20 | This is the highest and adventurer's score can go unless a feature says otherwise.
| 21-29 | This represents and extraordinary capability |
| 30 | This is the highest a score can go |


## Ability score modifiers

Each ability has an Ability Score modifier, which is derived from its Ability Score. The Ability Score modifiers are being added to any :d20-check: **Ability Checks**, :d20-save: **Saving Throws** and attack rolls a creature makes associated with that ability, as well as to the **Difficulty Class (DC)** of any spells that they cast.

Creatures also add an Ability Score modifier to Initiative rolls and some damage rolls they make, and some features allow creatures to add additional or alternative Ability Score modifiers to specific rolls.

An ability's modifier is decreased by 1 for every odd score below 10, and is increased by 1 for every even score above 10. Alternatively, it can be calculated by subtracting 10 from the Ability Score, then dividing by 2 and rounding down.
