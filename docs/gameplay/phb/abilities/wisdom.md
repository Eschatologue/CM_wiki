# Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

Wisdom is the recommended primary stat for :class-phb24-cleric: Clerics and :class-phb24-druid: Druids, and it is the spellcasting ability of :class-phb24-cleric: Clerics, :class-phb24-druid: Druids, :class-phb24-monk: Monks and :class-phb24-ranger: Rangers.

Wisdom is also an important ability for monks, as several of their class features benefit from it.

## Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

### Animal Handling

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. 

You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

### Insight

Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

### Medicine

A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

### Perception

Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.

For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

??? tip "Finding a Hidden Object"

    When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.

    In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

### Survival

The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

??? info "Other Wisdom Checks"
    
    The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

    - Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
    - Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

## Uses of Wisdom

### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the :d20-save: **Saving Throw** DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom saves

Wisdom saves are some of the most common saves in the game, frequently made to resist spells that test a creature's composure, willpower or self control.
