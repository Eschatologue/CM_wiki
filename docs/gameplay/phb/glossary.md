# Rule Glossary

## Glossary Conventions

The glossary uses the following conventions:

***Tags in Brackets.*** Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].” A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.

***“You.”*** The game’s rules—in this glossary and elsewhere—often talk about something happening to you in the game world. That “you” refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the “you” in the Prone condition is a creature that currently has that condition.

***“See Also.”*** Some glossary entries include a See also section that points to other entries in the glossary, to chapters in this book, or both.

***No Obsolete Terms.*** The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index.

***Abbreviations.*** The abbreviations listed below appear in this glossary and elsewhere in the rules.

## Ability Check

An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated with an ability—to overcome a challenge.

## Ability Score and Modifier

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test Test with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so.

## Action

On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which action to take from those below or from the special actions provided by your features. These actions are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

- Attack
- Dodge
- Dash
- Help
- Disengage
- Hide
- Influence
- Magic
- Ready
- Search
- Study
- Utilize

## Advantage

If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s, and use the higher roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other.

## Ally

A creature is your ally if it is a member of your adventuring party, your friend, on your side in combat, or a creature that the rules or the DM designates as your ally.
