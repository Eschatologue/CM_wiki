### Attack

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

The most common action to take in combat is the **Attack action**, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. This action often requires you to make an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** against the target's AC.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.

#### Disarm

When attacking using a melee weapon or Unarmed Strike, a creature can replace one of its attacks to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. 

The attacker makes an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

#### Unarmed Strike

An Unarmed Strike is a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect:

**Damage.** You make an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** against the target. Your bonus to hit equals your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.

**Grapple.** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw** (it chooses which), or it has the Grappled condition. The DC for the :d20-save: **Saving Throw** and any escape attempts equals `8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus`. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.

**Shove.** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw** (it chooses which), or you either push the target 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone condition. The DC for the :d20-save: **Saving Throw** equals ^^8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus^^. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you

### Cast a Spell

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action, :rsc-bonus-action: Bonus Action, or :rsc-reaction: Reaction

Spellcasters such as Wizards and Clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. 

Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. 

Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of Action, so a spellcaster often uses their action in combat to cast such a spell. 

### Dash

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Disengage

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw**s with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.

### End Concentration

**Cost:** None

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

### Help

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Help action, you do one of the 
following:

**Assist Ability Check.** Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who can perceive you. You give Advantage to the next ability check that ally makes with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. To give this assistance, you must be near enough to the ally to assist verbally or physically when the ally makes the check. The DM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.

**Assist :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**.** You momentarily distract an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to the next :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.

### Hide 

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so stealthily, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check while you're Heavily Obscured or behind Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must be out of any visible enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the Invisible condition. Make note of your check's total, which becomes the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom (Perception) check.

The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurrences: 

- You make a sound louder than a whisper 
- An enemy finds you, you make an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**
- You cast a spell with a verbal component.

### Identify a Spell

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action or :rsc-reaction: Reaction

A character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.

If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.

This Intelligence (Arcana) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.

### Magic

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Magic action, you magic something by casting a spell that has a casting time of an :rsc-action: Action or by using a feature or Magic Item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain Concentration while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.

### Opportunity Attack

**Cost:** :rsc-reaction: Reaction

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an Opportunity Attack.

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the Opportunity Attack, you use your rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.

Opportunity Attack is also often referred to as 'Attack of Opportunity', they are both the same.

### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.

**Determining Trigger.** First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."

**Condition Triggered.** When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

#### Readying a Spell 

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

### Search 

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what you're trying to detect.

##### Search

|---|---|
| Insight | Creature's state of mind |
| Medicine | Creature's ailment |

### Study

**Cost:** :rsc-action: Action

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a creature, a clue, an object, or another source of
knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.

The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on the area of knowledge the Intelligence check is about.
