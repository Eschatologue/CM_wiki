# Action

When you do something other than moving or communicating, you typically take an action. The Action table lists the game's main actions, which are defined more detail here.

##### Actions

| Action | Summary | 
|---|---|
| Attack | Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike |
| Dash | For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra movement equal to your Speed |
| Disengage | Your movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attack for the rest of the turn | 
| Dodge | Until the start of your next turn, Attack Rolls against you have :d20-disadv: Disadvantage, and you make Dexterity saving throw with :d20-adv: Advantage. You lost this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition or if your Speed is 0 |
| Help | Help another creature Ability Check or Attack Roll, or administer first aid |
| Hide | Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check | 
| Influence | Make Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Perfomance, or Persuassion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to alter a creature's attitude |
| Magic | Cast a Spell, use a magic item, or use a magical feature |
| Ready | Prepare to take an action in response to a trigger you define |
| Search| Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival) check |
| Study | Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, Investigation, or Survival) check | 
| Utilise | Use nonmagical object |

Player characters and monster can also do things not covered by these actuibs, Many ckass features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you wheter that action is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to make, if any.

## One Thing at a Time

The game uses actions to govern how much you can do at one time. **You can take only one action at a time**. This principle is most important in Combat.

Actions can come up in other situations too: In a social interactions, you can try to Influence a creatyre or use the Search action to read the creature's body language, but you can't do both at the same time. And when you're exploring a dungeon, you can't simultaneouslt use the Serach action to look for traps and use the Help action to aid another character who's trying to open a stuck door (with Utilise action)

## Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**. The Cunning Action feature for a Rogue, allows it to take a Bonus Action. You can take a Bonus Action **only** when a special ability, a spell, or another feature of the game states that you can do something as a Bonus Action. You otherwise don't have a Bonus Action to take.

You choose when to take a Bonus Action during your turn unless the Bonus Action's timing is specified. Anything that deprives you of the ability to take Actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus Action.

## Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow yout ake special actions called a :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** A Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someeone else's. The Opportunity Attack is the most common type of Reactions.

When you take a Reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, tjat creature can continue its turn right after the Reaction.

In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immediatelt after its trigger unless the Reaction's description says otherwise.
