# Exploration

Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact wiht the environment in such places.

## Adventuring Equipment

As adventures explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a ladder, or perceive things they wouldn't otherwise with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieve's Tools, abnd create obstacles with Caltrops.

## Vision and Light

Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing dangers, hitting an enemt, and targeting certain spells—are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below:

### Obscured Areas

An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A Heavily Obscured Area—such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. You have the Blinded condition when trying to see something there.

### Light

The presence of absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below.

#### Bright Light

Bright Light lets most creatures see normally, Even gloomy days provide Bright Light as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

#### Dim Light

Dim Light, also called shadows creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usuallt a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also countt as Dim Light. A full mon might bathe the land in Dim Light.

#### Darkness

Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit night), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in area of magical Darkness.

## Special Senses

Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations as follow:

- Blindsight
- Darkvision
- Tremorsense
- Truesight

## Hiding

Adventures and monsters often hide, whenever to spy one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush, The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide you take the Hide action.

## Interacting with Objects

Interacting wiht objects is often simple to resolve. The players tells the DM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the DM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as defined in the following sections:

### What is an Object?

For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or tone. It isn't a building or a vehicle which are composed of many objects

### Time-Limited Object Interaction

When time is short, such as in combat, interractions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That iteraction must occur during a creature's movement or action. Any additional interaction require the Utilise action, as explained in Combat in later section.

### Finding Hidden Objectts

When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided tou describe the character searching in the hidden object's vicinity. On success, you find the objext, other important detail, or both.

If you desccribe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won't reveal the object, no matter the check's total.

### Carrying Onjects

You can usually carry your gear and treasure with out worrying about the weight of these objects. If you try to haul an unnusually heavy object or a massive nmumber of lighter objects, the DM migh require you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity.
