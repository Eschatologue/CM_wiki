# Death Domain

> *Harness the Stillness of Death*

The Death domain deals with the inevitable end of life and the power that lingers beyond it. Its clerics serve forces that see death not as evil or sacred, but as a tool, a truth, or a threshold. Whether guiding souls, commanding undeath, or enforcing finality, they walk the line between reverence and exploitation. Their power reflects the cold, indifferent certainty that all things end.

### Level 3: Death Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Death Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Death Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: False Life],[:spell-lv1: Ray of Sickness], [:spell-lv2: Blindness/Deafness], [:spell-lv2: Ray of Enfeeblement] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Animate Dead], [:spell-lv3: Magic Circle] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Blight], [:spell-lv4: Death Ward] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Antilife Shell], [:spell-lv5: Cloudkill] |

### Level 3: Reaper

You learn one Necromancy cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you cast a Necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 30 feet of each other.

### Level 3: Hands of Death :ui-chdiv-cleric:{title="Uses Channel Divinity (Cleric)"}

You can use **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity** to destroy another creature's life force. When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity** to deal extra **(1d8 + Cleric level) :dmg-necr: Necrotic**{.dmg-necr} damage to the target.

### Level 6: Inescapable Destruction

Your ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{.dmg-necr} damage dealt by your Cleric spells and **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity** options ignores **:dmg-res: Resistance** to **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{.dmg-necr} damage.

### Level 17: Improved Reaper

When you cast a Necromancy spell that is level 5 or lower that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 30 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, you must provide them for both targets.
