# Arcana Domain

> *Channel Magic from its Divine Origin*

Magic is a force that permeates existence, capable of creating and destroying in equal measure. Deities of the Arcana Domain hold profound understanding of magic's secrets and its limitless potential. For some, magical knowledge is a sacred responsibility tied to a deeper comprehension of reality. Others view magic as raw power, wielded freely to shape the world.

These gods are often associated with the pursuit of knowledge, recognising the connection between learning and arcane mastery. Clerics of this domain serve as stewards of magical understanding, balancing the responsibilities and the power that come with wielding the arcane.

### Level 3: Arcana Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Arcana Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Arcana Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic], [:spell-lv1: Magic Missile], [:spell-lv2: Magic Weapon], [:spell-lv2: Nystul's Magic Aura] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Dispel Magic], [:spell-lv3: Magic Circle] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Arcane Eye], [:spell-lv4: Leomund's Secret Chest] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Planar Binding], [:spell-lv5: Teleportation Circle] |

### Level 3: Arcane Initiate

You have proficiency in the Arcana skill and when you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you can make it a Wisdom (Arcana) instead. Moreover, you learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list, which count as Cleric cantrips for you.

### Level 3: Collective Knowledge

You can use your **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity**{ .em } to bestow divine knowledge on yourself and your allies. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action, you present your holy symbol to emanate a divine source of truth in a 15 foot Emanation for 1 minute. You and all allies that are within the Emanation have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws and gain bonus to their Armour Class equals to half your Wisdom modifier (round up).

### Level 6: Spell Breaker

When you restore Hit Points to an ally with a spell of level 1 or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

### Level 17: Arcane Mastery

You choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6, 7, 8, and 9. You add them to your list of Domain spells. Like your other Domain spells, they are always prepared and count as Cleric spells for you.
