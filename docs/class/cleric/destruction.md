# Destruction Domain

> *Through Destruction, Balance is Restored*

The Spire of Destruction governs the natural radiant of entropy that drives the cycle of existence. Destruction is not an act of malice, but a necessary stage in the cosmic balance. It is the counterpart to creation, ensuring that from the ashes of what was, new growth and renewal may arise.

Clerics of this domain understand that resisting this cycle is to deny the truth of the world. They wield the power of the Destruction not as harbingers of ruin, but as agents of necessary change, ensuring balance through the radiants of decay and rebirth.

### Level 3: Destruction Domain Spells

Your connection to the Ascent of Destruction ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Destruction Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Destruction Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Magnify Gravity](../../spells/description/additional/dunamancy.md#magnify-gravity), [:spell-lv1: Tenser's Floating Disk], [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam], [:spell-lv2: Shatter] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Erupting Earth], [:spell-lv3: Thunderstep] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Fount of Moonlight], [:spell-lv4: Sickening Radiance] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance], [:spell-lv5: Immolation] |

### Level 3: Helium Flash

When you cast a Cleric spell that deals damage, you can change its damage type to **:dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force }.

### Level 3: Accretion Disk :ui-chdiv-cleric:{title="Uses Channel Divinity (Cleric)"}

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action, you can use your **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity**{ .em } to create a **15-foot :aoe-emn: Emanation** of a swirling ring of light and spinning dust that surrounds you for 1 minute. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition.  

When you manifest the Emanation and as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} on your subsequent turns, you can force all creatures of your choice within this Emanation to make a **:d20-save: CON Save**{.d20} against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, the creatures take **(Cleric level/2) :dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage, and their **:rsc-spd: Speed**{.mv} is halved until the end of their next turn. 

### Level 6: Quasar Jet  

When a target that is within your Accretion Disk's Emanation is hit by an attack roll, the target takes **(Cleric level/2) :dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage, and you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice.  

### Level 17: Catastrophic Resonance  

When you cast a Cleric spell that deals damage while your Accretion Disk is active, you can dismiss the Emanation on yourself and manifest the Accretion Disk centred on the spell's target. This special Accretion Disk affects a **15-foot :aoe-sphere: Sphere** centred on the spell's target and has the same effect and duration as the Emanation.  

Each time you cast a Cleric spell that deals damage, you can move one of these special Accretion Disks to its new location, following the same rulings.  

You can still manifest another Accretion Disk Emanation on yourself as normal. Only two Accretion Disks can exist at any given point, and you use the same **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} to activate both.
