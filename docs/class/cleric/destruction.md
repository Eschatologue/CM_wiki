# Destruction Domain

> *Through Destruction, Balance is Restored*

The Spire of Destruction governs the natural radiant of entropy that drives the cycle of existence. Destruction is not an act of malice, but a necessary stage in the cosmic balance. It is the counterpart to creation, ensuring that from the ashes of what was, new growth and renewal may arise.

Clerics of this domain understand that resisting this cycle is to deny the truth of the world. They wield the power of the Destruction not as harbingers of ruin, but as agents of necessary change, ensuring balance through the radiants of decay and rebirth.

### Level 3: Destruction Domain Spells

Your connection to the Ascent of Destruction ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Destruction Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
