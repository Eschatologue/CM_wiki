# Destruction Domain

> *Through Destruction, Balance is Restored - Written by Eschathologue*

The Spire of Destruction governs the natural force of entropy that drives the cycle of existence. Destruction is not an act of malice, but a necessary stage in the cosmic balance. It is the counterpart to creation, ensuring that from the ashes of what was, new growth and renewal may arise.

Clerics of this domain understand that resisting this cycle is to deny the truth of the world. They wield the power of destruction not as harbingers of ruin, but as agents of necessary change, ensuring balance through the forces of decay and rebirth.

### Level 3: Destruction Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Destruction Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | *Chromatic Orb*, *Tenser's Floating Disk*, *Spike Growth*, *Shatter* |
| 5 | *Fly*, *Erupting Earth* |
| 7 | *Grasping Vine*, *Sickening Radiance* |
| 9 | *Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance*, *Wall of Light* |

### Level 3: Quasar Jet

Whenever you do damage using a Cleric class feature or a Cleric spell that deals Force or Radiant damage, you can choose to change that damage type to the other (Radiant to Force, or Force to Radiant).

### Level 3: Accretion Disk

As a Magic action, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an aura of destructive energy in a 15-foot radius around you for 1 minute, which ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, or when you choose to end it early (no action required). While this aura is active, the following effects occur:

***Damage.*** When a creature you choose enters the aura for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it takes Radiant damage. The amount of damage is determined by rolling a number of d4s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 die).

***Gravitational Shift.*** You can use your Bonus Action to manipulate the energies within the aura to push or pull creatures. You can choose a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one) that are Large or smaller within the aura and either push them up to 5 feet away from you or pull them 5 feet closer to you. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. You can do this a number of time equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain all expended use when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 6: Distruptive Pulse

When you deal Force or Radiant damage to a Large or smaller creature, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. A creature affected by this feature cannot take Reactions.

### Level 17: The Witness of Creation

The Destruction has finally acknowledged your existence. You gain the following benefits:

***Resistance.*** You gain Resistance to Force and Radiant damage, and you are immune to the Force and Radiant damage from any Cleric spell you cast.

***Expanded Aura.*** The radius of your Accretion Disk aura expands to 30 feet, and the distance you can push or pull creatures using your Gravitational Shift feature increases to 10 feet.

***Gravity's Domination.*** Whenever a creature you choose starts its turn within your Accretion Disk, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 Force damage, and its Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of movement.
