# Cleric: Light Domain

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal.Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce every shadow and deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement. Religious orders focused on combating the Undead also draw on the power of this domain.

## Level 3: Radiance of Dawn

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit sunlight in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on yourself. Any magical darkness—such as that created by the Darkness spell—in the sphere is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your Cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Level 6: Revealing Light

As a Bonus Action, you can present your Holy Symbol and cast [See Invisibility] without expending a spell slot. When you cast it in this way, your allies also gain the benefit of the spell while within 10 feet of you. Until the spell ends, you emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early as a Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 17: Corona of Light

As a Magic action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the Bright Light have Disadvantage on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.
