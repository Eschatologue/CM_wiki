# Light Domain

> *Bring Light to Banish Darkness*

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce every shadow and deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Religious orders focused on combating the Undead also draw on the power of this domain.
