# Cleric

> *Clerics are representatives of the gods they worship, wielding potent divine magic for good or ill*

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

### Level 1: Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice:

#### Protector

Trained for battle, you gain Martial Weapon proficiency and Heavy Armour training.

#### Thaumaturge

You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list (see your Spellcasting feature for information on preparing spells). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the [Cleric spell list](../../spells/class-specific/cleric.md) later in the class's description.

#### Cantrips

You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. [:spell-lv0: Guidance], [:spell-lv0: Sacred Flame], and [:spell-lv0: Thaumaturgy] are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

#### Spell Slots

The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Prepared Spells of level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. [:spell-lv1: Bless], [:spell-lv1: Cure Wounds], [:spell-lv1: Guiding Bolt], and [:spell-lv1: Shield of Faith] are recommended.


The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing one or more of the spells there with other Divine spells for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell you add to the list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:ability-wis: **Wisdom** is your Spellcasting Ability for your Cleric spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.

### Level 2: Channel Divinity

You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: [:class-abl-chdiv-cleric: Divine Spark](#class-abl-chdiv-cleric-divine-spark) and [:class-abl-chdiv-cleric: Turn Undead](#class-abl-chdiv-cleric-turn-undead), each of which is described below. Each time you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create, and you gain additional effect options at higher levels in this class.

You can use **:class-abl-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity**{ .em } twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

#### :class-abl-chdiv-cleric: Divine Spark

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at them. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant (your choice) damage equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).
 
You roll an additional d8 when you reach certain Cleric levels: 7th level (2d8), 13th level (3d8), and 18th level (4d8).

#### :class-abl-chdiv-cleric: Turn Undead

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you present your Holy Symbol and speak a prayer censuring Undead creatures. Each Undead within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, you have the Incapacitated condition, or you die.

### Level 3: Cleric Subclass

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Cleric level or lower

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Smite Undead

You can cause your Turn Undead feature to smite the undying; whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll's total.

This damage doesn't end the turn effect.

### Level 7: Blesssed Strike

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice:

***Divine Strike***{ .inl } Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack with a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } or **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } damage (your choice).

***Potent Spellcasting***{ .inl } You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.
 
If you get either option from another source, you use only the option you chose for this feature.

### Level 9: Commune

In the past, you have reached the divine source of your power through prayer. Now you can also have brief conversations; you always have the Commune spell prepared.

### Level 10: Divine Intervention

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn't require a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can't use this feature again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

***Divine Strike***{ .inl } The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

***Potent Spellcasting***{ .inl } When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of **:dmg-temp: Temporary Hit Points**{ .dmg-heal } equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [:option-feat-boon: Epic Boon](../../option/feat/feat-boon.md) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can't use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.
