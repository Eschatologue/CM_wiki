# Twilight Domain

> *Defend Allies with the Soothing Twilight*

The transition from light to darkness often carries a sense of calm and renewal, as the day's efforts give way to the quiet of night. While the darkness can bring solace, it can also harbour unseen dangers.

Clerics of the Twilight Domain bring reassurance and protection, offering comfort to those seeking peace and venturing into the shadows to ensure the night remains a time of safety and rest, rather than fear.

### Level 3: Twilight Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Twilight Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Order Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Faerie Fire], [:spell-lv1: Sleep], [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam], [:spell-lv2: See Invisibility] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Aura of Vitality], [:spell-lv3: Leomund's Tiny Hut] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Aura of Life], [:spell-lv4: Greater Invisibility] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Circle of Power], [:spell-lv5: Mislead] |

### Level 3: Eyes of Night

*You can see through the deepest gloom.* 

You have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet and as a Magic action, you can share it with willing creatures you can see within 10 feet of you, up to a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), which lasts for 1 hour. Once you share it, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you expend a spell slot of any level to share it again.

### Level 3: Twilight Sanctuary

You can use your :class-phb24-cleric: **Channel Divinity** to refresh your allies with soothing twilight. As a Bonus Action, you present your holy symbol, and a 30-foot Emanation of dim light appears around you. It lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. When you activate this feature, and as a Bonus Action while it is active, you can grant one the following benefits to one creature within the Emanation of your choice:

***Fortitude.*** It gains Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d6 plus your Cleric level.

***Relief.*** You end the Charmed or Frightened condition on it.

### Level 6: Steps of Night

*You can draw on the mystical power of night to rise into the air.* 

When you are in dim light or darkness you can use your Bonus Action to give yourself a Fly Speed equal to your Speed for 1 minute. You can do so as part of the same Bonus Action you use to activate Twilight Sanctuary.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 17: Twilight Shroud

*The twilight that you summon offers a protective embrace.*

While you and any creature of your choice is within your Twilight Sanctuary Emanation, it has Half Cover.
