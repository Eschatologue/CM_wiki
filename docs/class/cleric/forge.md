# Forge Domain

> *Create Divine Masterwork*

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. 

Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. 

### Level 3: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Forge Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Level 3: Blessing of the Forge

You gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. 

**<Bonus Proficiency>** You gain a set of Smithâ€™s Tools and have proficiency with it.
Blessed Smithing. At the end of a Long Rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a weapon. Until the end of your next Long Rest or until you die, the object becomes a magical, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Artisan's Blessing

You can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items. You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you. The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation. The ritual can create a duplicate of a nonmagical item that contains metal, such as a key, if you possess the original during the ritual.

### Level 6: Soul of the Forge

Your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities. You have Resistance to Fire damage and while wearing metal armor, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

### Level 17: Saint of Forge and Fire

Your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful. You have Immunity to Fire damage and while wearing metal armor, you have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
