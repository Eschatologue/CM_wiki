# Forge Domain

> *Create Divine Masterwork*

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. 

Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. 

### Level 3: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Forge Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Forge Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |

| 3 | *Heat Metal*, *Identify*, *Magic Weapon*, *Burning Hands* |
| 5 | *Elemental Weapon*, *Protection from Energy* |
| 7 | *Fabricate*, *Wall of Fire* |

### Level 3: Blessing of the Forge

You gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armour. 

***Bonus Proficiency.*** You gain a set of Smithâ€™s Tools and have proficiency with it.

***Blessed Smithing.*** At the end of a Long Rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armour or a weapon. Until the end of your next Long Rest or until you die, the object becomes a magical, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armour or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Artisan's Blessing

You can use your Channel Divinity to create nonmagical metal items. Over an hour, you conduct a ritual to craft a metal-based item, such as a weapon, armour, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another object containing metal. The item appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and cannot be worth more than 1.000 SP. To create it, you must provide metal of equal value, which can include coins, which is consumed during the ritual. You can even create a copy of a nonmagical metal item, like a key, if you have the original.

### Level 6: Soul of the Forge

Your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities. You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-fire: Fire damage and while wearing metal armour, you have a +1 bonus to your Armour Class.

### Level 17: Saint of Forge and Fire

Your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful. You have :dmg-imm: Immunity to :dmg-fire: Fire damage and while wearing metal armour, you have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-blunt: Bludgeoning, :dmg-piercing: Piercing, and :dmg-slashing: Slashing damage.
