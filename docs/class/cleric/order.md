# Order Domain

> *Use Law to Subjugate and Delegate*

The Order Domain embodies discipline and dedication to the principles that govern societies, institutions, or philosophies. Clerics of this domain uphold logic and justice as they fulfil their sacred duties.

These clerics believe that well-constructed systems of rules establish rightful authority, and those entrusted with leadership must uphold these principles. Those who follow are expected to do so with integrity, while leaders who falter in their duties must be held accountable. In this way, the framework of order weaves a network of responsibilities that fosters stability and security amidst the chaos of existence.

### Level 3: Order Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Order Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Order Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Command], [:spell-lv1: Heroism], [:spell-lv2: Hold Person], [:spell-lv2: Zone of Truth] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Mass Healing Word], [:spell-lv3: Slow] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Compulsion], [:spell-lv4: Locate Creature] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Commune], [:spell-lv5: Dominate Person] |

### Level 3: Voice of Authority

You can invoke the power of law to embolden an ally to attack. If you cast a spell of level 1 or higher and target an ally with the spell, that ally can use their Reaction immediately after the spell to make one weapon attack against a creature of your choice that you can see. If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose the ally who can make the attack.

### Level 3: Order's Demand

You can use your **:ui-chdiv-cleric: Channel Divinity**{ .em } to exert an intimidating presence over others. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you present your holy symbol, and each creature of your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the end of your next turn or until the charmed creature takes any damage. You can also cause any of the Charmed creatures to drop what they are holding when they fail the saving throw.

### Level 6: Embodiment of the Law

You have become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the Enchantment school of level 1 or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally an action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 17: Order's Wrath

Enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. When you use your Voice of Authority feature to allow an ally to make an attack, you empower that attack with the power of law. If the attack hits, it deals an extra 2d10 Psychic damage.
