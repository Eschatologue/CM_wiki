# Tempest Domain

> *Smite Foes with the Wrath of the Sky*

The Tempest domain offers power from the forces of storms, sea, and sky. These divine forces represent the awe-inspiring power of lightning and thunder, the turbulent strength of the ocean, and the unpredictable nature of storms. They embody natural phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanic fury, as well as the raw power of violence, courage, and strength. Tempest clerics are often tasked with delivering swift justice, inspiring reverence, or instilling fear to ensure that mortals respect the might of these forces. 

Some Tempest clerics are honoured as protectors of seafarers, while others serve as reminders of natureâ€™s wrath, channelling their divine power to keep the faithful on the righteous path or to prevent divine fury through propitiation.

### Level 3: Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Tempest Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Tempest Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
| :-: | --- |
| 3 | *Fog Cloud*, *Gust of Wind*, *Shatter*, *Thunderwave* |
| 5 | *Call Lightning,*, *Sleet Storm* |
| 7 | *Control Water*, *Ice Storm* |
| 9 | *Destructive Wave*, *Insect Plague* |

### Level 3: Wrath of the Storm

You can :dmg-thunder: thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your :rsc-r: **Reaction** to force the creature to make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature takes :dmg-lighting: Lightning or :dmg-thunder: Thunder (your choice) damage equal to 1d8 plus your Cleric level, or half as much damage on a successful save. 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Destructive Wrath

You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity. When you roll :dmg-lighting: Lightning or :dmg-thunder: Thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.

### Level 6: Thunderous Strike

When you deal :dmg-lighting: Lightning or :dmg-thunder: Thunder damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

### Level 17: Stormborn

The winds of the tempest lift your form into the air. You have a Fly speed equal to your :rsc-speed: Speed.
