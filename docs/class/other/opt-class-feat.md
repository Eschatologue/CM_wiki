# Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain.

**Replacement**{ .inl } If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it. 

## Barbarian

### Level 1: Unarmoured Defence (Strength)

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-barb-unarmoured-defence] -->


_Optional Class Feature, Replaces **[Unarmoured Defence]**_

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armour Class equals **10 + your :abl-str: Strength and :abl-cons: Constitution modifiers**{ .calc }. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

## Ranger

### Level 1: Ranger's Aptitude

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-rng-aptitude] -->

*Optional Class Feature*

You gain invaluable knowledge, experiences, or hard-earned lessons, which is represented by Ranger's Aptidude. You gain one aptidude of your choice. Aptidude are described in the "[Ranger's Aptitude Options]" section later in this class's description.

**Prerequisites**{ .inl } If an aptidude has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that aptidude. For example, if an aptidude requires you to be a level 5+ Ranger, you can select the aptidude once you reach Ranger level 5. If another Ranger feature gives you Aptitude, those Aptitude don't count against the number of Aptitudes you know with this feature.

**Replacing and Gaining Aptidudes**{ .inl } Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of your aptidudes with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an aptidude if it's a prerequisite for another aptidude that you have.

**Spell**{ .inl } If an aptidude grants a spell, it is considered a Ranger spell for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability.

**Proficiency**{ .inl } If an aptidude grants proficiency in a skill you already have, choose a different proficiency available to the Core Ranger Trait table.

When you gain certain Ranger levels, you gain more aptidudes of your choice, as shown in the Aptidudes column of the Ranger Features table.

You can't pick the same aptidude more than once unless its description says otherwise.

## Paladin

### Level 2: Divine Smite

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-pal-smite] -->

_Optional Class Feature, Replaces **[Paladin's Smite]**_

When you damage a creature with a Melee weapon attack or an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } , you can expend a spell slot to cause that attack to deal **bonus damage** to the target. This feature also changes the damage type dealt from _**Radiant Strike**_ feature. This bonus damage is `2d8` for a level 1 spell slot and it increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 1, to a maximum of `6d8`.

The bonus damage of this feature depends on your alignment, or freely choose from the following table.

| Alignment | Damage Type |
|:-:|:-:|
| Good | **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } |
| Neutral | **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } |
| Evil | **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } |
