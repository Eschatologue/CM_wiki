# Oath of the Blade

Paladins who swear the Oath of the Blade dedicate their lives to becoming masters of combat. Often given the title of Blade Master, these paragons of battle strive for mastery with the armaments of war. Some serve as mercenaries, and others as guardians or bodyguards. However, no matter their station Paladins of the Blade always look to test their martial skills.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Level the playing field for a fair fight.
- All warriors deserve respect, even the most bitter foes.

Your use of Channel Divinity is not expended if the creature succeed the saving throw.
