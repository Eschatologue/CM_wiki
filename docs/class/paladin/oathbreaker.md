# Oathbreaker

> *Forsake your Sacred Vow and Embrace Evil*

An oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks their sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished.

Only darkness remains.

Having forsaken their oath, Oathbreakers follow no tenets.

### Level 3: Oath Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oathbreaker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oathbreaker Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Hellish Rebuke], [:spell-lv1: Inflict Wounds] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Crown of Madness], [:spell-lv2: Darkness] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Bestow Curse], [:spell-lv3: Shackles of Pain]^*CM*^ |

### Level 3: Corrupting Will

Your blasphemous will can corrupt and conquer the souls of others. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can expend a use of your **:ui-chdiv-pal: Channel Divinity** to force a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for 1 minute. For the duration, you can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to issue one of the following commands to an affected creature.

**Enforce**{ .inl } You can issue a one word command to the creature as if by the [:spell-lv1: Command] spell.

**Madness**{ .inl } You can command the creature to use its action to attack a creature other than itself of your choice.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the Charmed condition on itself on a success.

### Level 7: Aura of Corruption

Your presence weakens your enemies who dare attempt to escape your wrath. When a creature in your Aura of Protection attempts to Move away from you, you can force that creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature's Speed becomes 0 and you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on the next attack you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.

### Level 15: Unholy Resistance

Unholy magic courses through you. You have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning, :dmg-prcg: Piercing and :dmg-slsh: Slashing damage.

### Level 20: Dread Lord

Your connection to the unholy grants you a shroud of gloom. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can surround yourself in gloom in a 30-foot Emanation. This Emanation lasts for 10 minutes. Bright light in this area becomes dim light. Whenever a creature hits another creature with a weapon attack while it is within this Emanation, you can choose to have that creature deal half damage. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, or you expend a level 5 spell slot to use it again.
