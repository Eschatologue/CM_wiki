# Oath of Conquest 

> *Subjugate the Unworthy with an Iron Fist*

The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn’t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.

These Paladins share the following tenets:

- Your victory must be overwhelming, douse the flames of hope.
- Tolerate no dissent. Your word is law.
- Never be complacent in your rule, for forces will rise to challenge it.

### Level 3: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Conquest Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of Conquest Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Bane], [:spell-lv1: Command] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Hold Person], [:spell-lv2: Spiritual Weapon] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Bestow Curse], [:spell-lv3: Fear] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Dominate Beast], [:spell-lv4: Stoneskin] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Cloudkill], [:spell-lv5: Dominate Person] |

### Level 3: Conquering Presence

When you hit a creature, you can use your Channel Divinity to channel a terrifying presence. The target of the triggering attack must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn. You can attempt to Frighten a creature again in this way once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack for the next minute.

### Level 3: Guided Strike

You can use your Channel Divinity to guide attacks with supernatural accuracy. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses a target with an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to grant a +10 bonus to the roll, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

### Level 7: Aura of Conquest

By your mere presence your foes are frozen in fear. If a creature has the Frightened condition and you are the source of its fear, its Speed is reduced to 0 while in your Aura of Protection, and that creature takes :dmg-psyc: Psychic damage equal to half your Paladin level if it starts its turn there.

### Level 15: Scornful Rebuke

Those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes :dmg-psyc: Psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you do not have the Incapacitated condition

### Level 20: Invincible Conqueror

You gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 10 minutes:

**Damage Resistance**{ .inl } You have resistance to all damage.

**Extra Attack**{ .inl } When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.

**Brutal Attacks**{ .inl } Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, or you expend a level 5 spell slot to use it again.
