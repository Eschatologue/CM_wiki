# Oath of Watchers 

> *Defend the World from Invading Forces*

The Oath of the Watchers binds Paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.

Paladins who follow the Watchers’ oath are ever vigilant in spotting the influence of extraplanar forces, often establishing a network of spies and informants to gather information on suspected cults. To a Watcher, keeping a healthy suspicion and awareness about one’s surroundings is as natural as wearing armor in battle.

These Paladins share the following tenets:

- Be ever alert for the corruption of invading forces.
- Never accept gifts or favors from fiends or those who truck with them.
- Keep your blade sharp and your mind keen with strict discipline

### Level 3: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Watchers Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of Watchers Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Alarm], [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam], [:spell-lv2: See Invisibility] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Counterspell], [:spell-lv3: Nondetection] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Aura of Purity], [:spell-lv4: Banishment] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster], [:spell-lv5: Scrying] |

### Level 3: Watcher’s Will

You invest your presence with the warding power of your faith. As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

### Level 7: Aura of the Sentinel

When you or a creature of your choice within your Aura of Protection rolls for Initiative, it adds your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) to the roll.

### Level 15: Vigilant Rebuke

You’ve learned how to chastise anyone who dares wield beguilements against you and your wards. Whenever you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you succeeds on an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can use your Reaction to deal 2d8 + your Charisma modifier Force damage to the creature that forced the saving throw.

### Level 20: Mortal Bulwark

You manifest a spark of divine power in defense of the mortal realms. As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you gain the following benefits for 10 minutes:

***Truesight.*** You gain Truesight with a range of 120 feet.

***Invader’s Bane.*** You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on attack rolls against Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, and Fiends.

***Extraplanar Banishment***. When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it’s currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can’t be banished by this feature for 24 hours.

Once you use this :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you expend a level 5 spell slot to use it again.
