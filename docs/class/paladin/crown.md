# Oath of the Crown 

> *Defend Civilization and Law from Tyranny*

The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. 

These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.

These Paladins share the following tenets:
- Respect and uphold the law.
- Stay true to those you are loyal to.
- Have courage to face threats, even against overwhelming odds.
- Take responsibility for the consequences of your actions. 

### Level 3: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of the Crown Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of the Crown Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Command], [:spell-lv1: Shield of Faith] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Warding Bond], [:spell-lv2: Zone of Truth] |

### Level 3: Champion Challenge

When you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, you can use your Channel Divinity to issue a challenge that compels other creatures to do battle with you. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from you, and has **:d20-disadv: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on attack rolls against creatures other than you. 

This effect ends on the creature after 1 minute, and ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, die, or if the creature is more than 30 feet away from you.

### Level 3: Turn the Tide

As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can bolster injured creatures with your Channel Divinity. Each creature of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

### Level 7: Aura of Allegiance

You exude an aura that bolsters the resolve of your allies. When a creature that is friendly to you starts its turn in your Aura of Protection, you can grant that creature Temporary Hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.

### Level 15: Unyielding Saint

You are an unstoppable force for your cause. You have :dmg-imm: Immunity to the Paralyzed and Stunned conditions, you cannot unwillingly gain the Prone or Unconscious conditions, and you cannot be forcefully moved against your will.

### Level 20: Exalted Champion

Your presence on the field of battle is an inspiration to those dedicated to your cause. As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can gain the following benefits for 10 minutes:

***Damage Resistance.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning, :dmg-prcg: Piercing and :dmg-slsh: Slashing damage.

***Regal Presence.*** When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 10 :dmg-psyc: Psychic damage and has the ^^Prone^^ condition and cannot stand up. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat this save, ending the effect preventing it from removing the ^^Prone^^ condition from itself on a successful save, and taking 10 :dmg-psyc: Psychic damage on a failed save.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a Long Rest, or you expend a level 5 spell slot to use it again.
