# Oath of the Bastion

> *Stand Unbreakable*

The Oath of the Bastion binds paladins to the ideals of unyielding defence and indomitable will. Paladins who taken this oath are like living siege engines, unleashing precise volleys of devastating firepower while protecting what remains. Their duty is not to seek glory nor reward but to hold the line, no matter the cost.

In times of crisis, when others flee, they stay behind, reinforcing defences and buying precious time for the helpless. They are the shield that never breaks, and when the end comes, they meet it standing, unshaken and unbowed.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Never retreat. Stand firm, no matter the odds.
- Sacrifice everything to shield others.
- Hold strong, even when hope fades.

### Level 3: Heavy Archer

You gain the [Strongbow](../../character-creation/feat/feat-fighting-style.md#strongbow) or [Thrown Weapon Fighting](../../character-creation/feat/feat-fighting-style.md#thrown-weapon-fighting) Fighting Style feat (choose one)

Moreover, your training gives you mastery of combat styles that uses **Bastion Weapons**, which are the following:

- Ranged Simple or Martial Weapon with the :weapon-prop-two-handed: **Two-Handed** property.
- Weapon that has the :weapon-prop-thrown: **Thrown** property and *lacks* the :weapon-prop-light: **Light** property 

You gain the following benefit with **Bastion Weapons**:

***Ranged Smites.*** When you hit a target with a ranged attack using a **Bastion Weapon**, you can apply your *Divine Smite* or Paladin Smite spells (such as *Searing Smite* or *Shining Smite*) to that attack. However, the damage die for these smites is reduced by one size (e.g. from a d10 to a d8).

When you reach level 11 in this class, your **Radiant Strikes** feature can also be applied to ranged attacks with **Bastion Weapons**, but the damage die becomes a d6 instead of a d8.

- A fixed point on the ground, or
- A creature (including yourself), which causes the zone to move with them.

This protective zone lasts for **1 minute**. While active, whenever a creature within **15 feet** of the marked point takes any action or moves, you can make a ranged weapon attack against them using a **Bastion Weapon** (if within normal range). This attack doesnâ€™t require any action and can be made up to a number of times equal to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum of 1).
