# Oath of the Bastion

> *Stand Unbreakable*

The Oath of the Bastion binds paladins to the ideals of unyielding defence and indomitable will. Paladins who taken this oath are like living siege engines, unleashing precise volleys of devastating firepower while protecting what remains. Their duty is not to seek glory nor reward but to hold the line, no matter the cost.

In times of crisis, when others flee, they stay behind, reinforcing defences and buying precious time for the helpless. They are the shield that never breaks, and when the end comes, they meet it standing, unshaken and unbowed.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Never retreat. Stand firm, no matter the odds.
- Sacrifice everything to shield others.
- Hold strong, even when hope fades.

### Level 3: Guardian's Mark

As :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to choose a point or a creature within 60 feet, designating its surrounding as a zone of protection, choose one of the following within 60 feet:

- A fixed point on the ground, or
- A creature (including yourself), which causes the zone to move with them.

This protective zone lasts for 1 minute. While active, each time a creature within 15 feet of the marked point takes :rsc-a: Action, :rsc-b: Bonus Action, :rsc-r: Reaction, or moves, you can make a Ranged weapon attack against them using a Heavy Archer weapon (if within normal range). This attack doesn't require any action and can be made up to a number of times equal to your :ability-cha: Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You cannot take any :rsc-r: Reactions until the start of your next turn after using this attack. 

This protective zone ends early if you either if you sse up all the allowed attacks, or when you have the ^^Incapacitated^^ condition.

### Level 3: Heavy Archer

Unlike other Paladins, you have improved training with Ranged weapons.

***Fighting Style.*** You gain one of the Fighting Style feats of your choice from the following options: [Strongbow] or [Thrown Weapon Fighting]. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange your selection for another option.

***Heavy Archer Weapons.*** Your have special training with Heavy Archer weapons, which are Ranged or Thrown weapon that lacks the :weapon-prop-light: Light property. You gain the following benefit with Heavy Archer weapons:

:   ***Ranged Smites.*** When you hit a target with a ranged attack using a Heavy Archer weapon, you can apply your Divine Smite or Paladin Smite spells (such as *Searing Smite* or *Shining Smite*) to that attack. However, the damage die for these smites is reduced by one size (e.g. from a d10 to a d8). When you reach level 11 in this class, your **Radiant Strikes** feature can also be applied to ranged attacks with Heavy Archer weapons, but the damage die becomes a d6 instead of a d8.

[^1]: *Forced Movement* occurs when a creature is moved by an external force, such as a spell or ability, without using its own movement, Actions, or Reactions. Common examples include being pushed, pulled, or moved by effects like *Thunderwave* or a Battle Master's *Pushing Attack*. Forced movement does **not** provoke Opportunity Attacks and is not limited by a creature's movement speed.
