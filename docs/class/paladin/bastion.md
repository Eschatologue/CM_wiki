# Oath of the Bastion

> *Stand Unbreakable*

The Oath of the Bastion binds paladins to the ideals of unyielding defence and indomitable will. Paladins who taken this oath are akin to living siege engines, unleashing precise volleys of devastating firepower while protecting what remains. Their duty is not to seek glory nor reward but to hold the line, no matter the cost.

In times of crisis, when others flee, they stay behind, reinforcing defences and buying precious time for the helpless. They are the shield that never breaks, and when the end comes, they meet it standing, unshaken and unbowed.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Never retreat. Stand firm, no matter the odds.
- Sacrifice everything to shield others.
- Hold strong, even when hope fades.

### Level 3: Heavy Archer

You gain the *Strongbow* or *Thrown Weapon Fighting* Fighting Style feat (choose one)

Moreover, your training gives you mastery of combat styles that uses **Bastion Weapons**, which are the following:

- Ranged Simple or Martial Weapon with the :weapon-prop-two-handed: **Two-Handed** property.
- Weapon that has the Thrown property and lacks the Light property 

You gain the following benefits with **Bastion Weapons**:

***Ranged Smites.*** When you hit a target with a Ranged attack with **Bastion Weapons**, you can use your Divine Smite feature or any Paladin Smite spells (e.g. *Searing Smite*, *Shinning Smite*) to that attack, but its damage die is reduced by one size (e.g. d10 to d8).

When you reach level 11 in this class, the Improved Divine Smite feature can also be used with **Bastion Weapon** and its damage die is a **d6** instead of **d8**.

***Heavyshot.*** If your attack roll with **Bastion Weapon** misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can't be increased in any way, other than increasing the ability modifier.

### Level 3: Oath of Bastion Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Bastion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of Bastion spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | *Gift of Alacrity*, *Hunter's Mark* |
| 5 | *Cordon of Arrows*, *Warding Bond* |
| 9 | *Conjure Barrage*, *Lightning Arrow* |
| 13 | *Arcane Eye*, *Stoneskin* |

### Level 3: Guardian's Mark

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to choose a point or a creature within 60 feet, designating its surrounding as a zone of protection. If you choose a point, it remains fixed. If you choose a creature (including yourself), the marked point moves with them.

This effect lasts for 1 minute. While active, when a creature you can see takes any action or moves within 15 feet of the marked point, you can make a ranged weapon attack against it with each triggering action or movement using a **Bastion Weapon**, provided it is within your weapon's normal range. This attack does not require an action and can be made a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). 

The effect ends early if you reach this number of attacks or when you have the Incapacitated condition.

If you make an attack using this feature, you cannot take Reactions until the start of your next turn.

### Level 7: Phalanx Formation

You and your allies has Immunity to Forced Movement while within your Aura of Protection. 

Moreover, you and your allies gain the benefit of Half Cover while within the aura, so long you haven't move more than half your Speed for this turn.

### Level 15: Rapid Reaction

When a hostile creaure ends their turn within your Aura of Protection, you can take a Reaction to move up to half of your Speed, without provoking Opportunity Attack and make a Ranged weapon attack using a **Bastion Weapon** at the creature.

You can use this feature a number of time equals to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses whenever you finish a Long Rest.
