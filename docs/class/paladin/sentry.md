# Oath of the Bastion

> *Stand Unbreakable*

The Oath of the Bastion binds paladins to the ideals of unyielding defence and indomitable will. Paladins who taken this oath are akin to living siege engines, unleashing precise volleys of devastating firepower while protecting what remains. Their duty is not to seek glory nor reward but to hold the line, no matter the cost.

In times of crisis, when others flee, they stay behind, reinforcing defences and buying precious time for the helpless. They are the shield that never breaks, and when the end comes, they meet it standing, unshaken and unbowed.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Never retreat. Stand firm, no matter the odds.
- Sacrifice everything to shield others.
- Hold strong, even when hope fades.

### Level 3: Divine Archer

You gain the [Strongbow] Fighting Style. If you already have this Fighting Style, the bonus damage it grants increases to +2. This Fighting Style cannot be replaced.

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can use your Divine Smite feature or any Paladin smite spell (e.g. *Searing Smite*, *Thunderous Smite*) with that attack. However, the damage dice for these features are reduced by one size (e.g. d6 becomes d4, d10 becomes d8, etc.).
