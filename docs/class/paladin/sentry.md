# Oath of the Bastion

> *Stand Unbreakable*

The Oath of the Bastion binds paladins to the ideals of unyielding defence and indomitable will. Paladins who taken this oath are akin to living siege engines, unleashing precise volleys of devastating firepower while protecting what remains. Their duty is not to seek glory nor reward but to hold the line, no matter the cost.

In times of crisis, when others flee, they stay behind, reinforcing defences and buying precious time for the helpless. They are the shield that never breaks, and when the end comes, they meet it standing, unshaken and unbowed.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Never retreat. Stand firm, no matter the odds.
- Sacrifice everything to shield others.
- Hold strong, even when hope fades.

### Level 3: Heavy Archer

You gain the Strongbow or Thrown Weapon Fighting Fighting Style feat (choose one)

Moreover, your training gives you mastery of combat styles that uses Bastion Weapons, which are the following:

- Ranged Weapon that has the Two-Handed property.
- Weapon that has the Thrown property.

You gain the following benefits with Bastion Weapons:

***Ranged Smites.*** When you hit a Ranged attack with Bastion Weapons, you can use your Divine Smite feature or any Paladin Smite spells (e.g. Searing Smite, Shinning Smite) to that attack, but its damage die is reduced by one size (e.g. d10 to d8).

When you reach level 11 in this class, the Improved Divine Smite feature can also be used with Bastion Weapon.

***Heavyshot.*** If your attack roll with Bastion Weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the  attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can't be increased in any way, other than increasing the ability modifier.
