# Oath of Glory

*Strive for Heights of Heroism*

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Endeavor to be known by your deeds.
- Face hardships witth courage
- Inspire other to strive for Glory

### Level 3: Inspiring Smite

Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with *Divine Smite*, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and distribute Temporary Hit Points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, which can include you. The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals 2d8 plus your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

### Level 3: Oath if GLory Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | Guiding Bolt, Heroism |
| 5 | Enhance Ability, Magic Weapon |
| 9 | Haste, Protection from Energy |
| 13 | Compulsion, Freedom of Movement |
| 17 | Commune, Yolande's Regal Presence |

### Level 3: Peerless Athlete

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

### Level 7: Aura Of Alacrity

Your Speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, whenever an ally enters your Aura of Protextion for the first tome on a turn or starts their turn there, the ally's Speed increased by 10 feet until the end of their turn.

### Level 15: Glorious Defense

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this Reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon's range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 20: Living Legend

You can empower yourself with the legends— whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a Bonus Action, you gain the following benefits for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

***Charismatic***. You are blessed with an otherworldly presence, gaining advantage on all Charisma checks.

***Saving Throw Reroll.*** If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it. You must use this new roll.

***Uneerring Strike.*** Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead.
