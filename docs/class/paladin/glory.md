# Oath of Glory

Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they’re all ready when destiny calls.

### Tenets of Glory

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Glory vary, Paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Actions over Words.*** Strive to be known by glorious deeds, not words.

***Challenges Are but Tests.*** Face hardships with courage, and encourage your allies to face them with you.

***Hone the Body.*** Like raw stone, your body must be worked so its potential can be realized.

***Discipline the Soul.*** You must marshal the discipline to overcome failings within yourself that threaten to dim the glory of you and your friends.

## Level 3: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3rd | Guiding Bolt, Heroism |
| 5th | Enhance Ability, Magic Weapon |
| 9th | Haste, Protection from Energy |
| 13th | Compulsion, Freedom of Movement |
| 17th | Commune, Flame Strike |

## Level 3: Inspiring Smite

Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with any of your Paladin’s Smite spells, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and distribute Temporary Hit Points to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, which can include you. The total number of Temporary Hit Points equals 2d8 + your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like.

## Level 3: Peerless Athlete

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks; you can carry, push, drag, and lift twice as much weight as normal; and the distance of your long and high jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal).

## Level 7: Aura Of Alacrity

Your Speed increases by 10 feet, and the Speed of any ally who starts their turn in your Aura of Protection increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

## Level 15: Glorious Defense

You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to grant a bonus to the target’s AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of this Reaction, provided the attacker is within your weapon’s range.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 20: Living Legend

You can empower yourself with the legends— whether true or exaggerated—of your great deeds. As a Bonus Action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
