# Oath of Vengeance

> *Punish Evildoers at Any Cost*

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countrysideâ€”at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

The paladins sharre the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.
 
### Level 3: Oath Spells

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | *Bane*, *Hunter's Mark* |
| 5 | *Hold Person*, *Misty Step* |
| 9 | *Haste*, *Protection from Energy* |
| 13 | *Banishment*, *Dimension Door* |
| 17 | *Hold Monster*, *Scrying* |
 
### Level 3: Vow Of Enmity

When you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, you can expend one use of your **:ui-chdiv-pal: Channel Divinity** to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You gain **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute.

If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).

### Level 7: Relentless Avenger

Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature's Speed to 0, and you can then move up to half your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } as part of the same Reaction. This Movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.

### Level 15: Soul Of Vengeance

Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within range.

### Level 20: Avenging Angel

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you gain the following benefits for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

**Flight**{.inl} You sprout spectral wings on your back. You have a Fly Speed equal to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } and can Hover.

**Frightful Aura**{.inl} Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have Advantage.
