# Paladin

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

A Paladin swears to stand against corrupting influences and to hunt the forces of ruin wherever they lurk. Different Paladins focus on various aspects of these causes, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield—power to heal the sick and injured, to smite their foes, and to protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world's armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then, their loyalty is first to their sacred oaths, not to crown and country.

Adventuring Paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or a dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Malign forces lurk in dungeons, and even the smallest victory against them can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.

- **Hit Points at Level 1:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points per later Level:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier

### Starting Equipment

As a Level 1 character, you start with the following equipment

- Chain Mail 
- Holy Symbol 
- Javelin (6) 
- Longsword
- Priest's Pack 
- Shield
- 90 SP

Or you can forgo it and spend 150 GP on equipment of your choice.

### Level 1: Lay On Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

In addition, you can expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature, rather than using those points to restore Hit Points.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer, meditation, and devotion. See the Player's Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Paladin.

### Spell Slots

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

### Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level

You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two 1st-level spells from the Paladin spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with Heroism and Searing Smite.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin table.

Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
 
If another Paladin feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for your Paladin spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the Mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

### Level 2: Paladin'S Smite

You have mastered smiting your targets with divine energy. You always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Smite Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

In addition, you can cast one of your prepared spells from this feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you use this benefit again.

#### Smite Spells

| Palading Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 2 | Divine Smite, Thunderous Smite |
| 5 | Shining Smite |
| 9 | Blinding Smite |
| 13 | Staggering Smite |
| 17 | Banishing Smite |

### Level 2: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a [Fighting Style] feat of your choice (those feats have this feature as a prerequisite).

[Fighting Style](../../character-creation/feat/feat-fighting-style.md)

### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create from among those you have from this class.

You can use Channel Divinity twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Paladin levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Paladin table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the Spell Save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

### Divine Sense

As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

### Level 3: Paladin Subclass

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice: 

- Oath of Devotion 
- Oath of Glory
- Oath of the Ancients
- Oath of Vengeance

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Paladin level and lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement](../../character-creation/feat/feat-general.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

As shown on the Bard table, you gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 5: Faithful Steed

You can easily call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the Find Steed spell prepared.
You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
 
### Level 6: Aura Of Protection

You radiate a protective, invisible aura that extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but it doesn't extend through Total Cover. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which one when entering the auras.

### Level 9: Abjure Foes

As a Magic action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with divine awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Dazed and Frightened conditions for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

### Level 10: Aura Of Courage

You and your allies are immune to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

### Level 11: Radiant Strikes

You are so suffused with divine might that your weapon strikes carry supernatural power with them. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.
 
### Level 14: Restoring Touch

When you use Lay on Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Dazed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay on Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

### Level 18: Aura Expansion

Your Aura of Protection now extends 30 feet from you rather than 10 feet.
