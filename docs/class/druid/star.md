    Though Circle of the Stars subclass exist in 2024 PHB, this one is a slight modification from the official version.

### Level 3: Star Map

You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the [Star Map table] or by choosing one.

While holding the map, you have the [:spell-lv0: Guidance] and [:spell-lv1: Guiding Bolt] spells prepared, and you can cast [:spell-lv1: Guiding Bolt] without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your :abl-wis: Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, and it destroys the previous map.

### Level 3: Starry Form

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can expend a use of your **:material-paw: Wild Shape** feature to take on a starry form, rather than shape shifting.

While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart.  
This form sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional **10 feet**. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition, or use this feature again.

Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.

**Archer**

:   A constellation of an archer appears on you. You gain the following benefits.

    **Luminous Arrow**{ .inl } When you activate this form, and as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a Ranged Spell Attack, hurling a Luminous Arrow that targets one creature within **60 feet** of you. On a hit, the attack deals **(1d8 + Wisdom modifier) :dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } damage.

**Chalice**

    **Chalice Healing**{ .inl } Whenever you cast a spell using a Spell Slot that restores **:trt-hp: Hit Points** to a creature, you or another creature within **30 feet** of you can regain **:trt-hp: Hit Points** equal to **1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier**.

**Dragon**

:   A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. You gain the following benefits.

    **Dragon's Wisdom**{ .inl } When you make an **:d20-check: Intelligence** or a **:d20-check: Wisdom** check or a **:d20-save: Constitution save** to maintain **:spell-conc: Concentration** on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

### Level 6: Cosmic Omen

*You learn to use your star map to divine the will of the cosmos.* 

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

**:rsc-r: Weal (even)**{ .inl } Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.
{ .indt }

**:rsc-r: Woe (odd)**{ .inl } Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a D20 Test, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.
{ .indt }

You can use use this **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 10: Twinkling Constellations

You are more closely attuned to the cosmic forces, giving you the following benefits.

**Starry Form Improvements**{.inl} The constellations of your Starry Form improves.

- _**Archer.**_ You can make two Ranged spell attack instead of once when making your Archer Form's **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } attack.
- _**Chalice.**_ You can choose two targets instead of one to receive **:trt-hp: Hit Points** from **Chalice Healing**.
- _**Dragon.**_ You have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover.

**Swift Attunement**{.inl} At the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.

### Level 14: Full of Stars

While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you **:dmg-res: Resistance** to **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps}, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps}, and **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{.dmg-bps} damage.

### Level 14: Star Flare

*Your connection to the cosmos lets you summon radiant starlight.*

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you conjure a burst of light in a **30-foot :aoe-sphere: Sphere** centered on a point within **120 feet** of you. You can Teleport each willing creature in the area to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of its current location.

Any creature remaining in the Sphere must make a **:d20-save: CON Save** against your **Spell Save DC**. On a failed save, the creature takes **4d12 :dmg-radi: Radiant**{.dmg-radi} damage and has the **Blinded**{ .cond } condition until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature only takes half damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, or you can expend a level 5+ spell slot to regain your use of it (no action required).
