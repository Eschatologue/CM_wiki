# Circle of the Moon

> *Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds*

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on the magic of the moon to transform themselves and to guard the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and perform rituals.

They wander the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks before crossing paths with another person, let alone another Druid.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid's blood.

### Level 3: Circle Forms  

You have learned ancient techniques that allow you to channel lunar magic when you assume a Wild Shape form, granting you the following benefits:

***Challenge Rating.*** The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).

***Armour Class.*** Your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier until you leave the form.

***Temporary Hit Points.*** You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to three times your Druid level.

### Level 3: Circle Spells

Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Moon Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

In addition, you can cast the spells from this feature while you are in Wild Shape form.
