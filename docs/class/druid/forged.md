# Circle of the Forged

> *Union of Flesh and Steel*

What does it mean to be truly natural? Can a being made of wood and steel possess the spark of life? Druids of the Circle of the Forged challenge these boundaries, embracing the fusion of living creatures and machines. This circle represents a radical sect of druids who are deeply devoted to Valinor’s generator–which they revere as the new form of the Tree of Life. In their quest for greater attunement with their Omnissiah, whom they see as the embodiment of Harmony, they have replaced their own organic parts with mechanical augmentations.

### Level 3: Caretaker of Irminsul

You gain proficiency with Tinker's Tool or Smith's Tool, and one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice. You can use your Wisdom when you make ability checks using those tools.

### Level 3: Skin of Steel

Through the fusion of ancient druidic techniques and advanced technology, you enhance your Wild Shape with mechanical augmentations, granting you the following benefits:

***Challenge Rating***. The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).

***Armor Class.*** Your AC becomes 13 + your Wisdom modifier while in this form.

***Temporary Hit Points.*** You gain temporary hit points equal to three times your Druid level.

***Poison Resistance.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you gain resistance to poison damage.

***Machine Body.*** While transformed, you do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.

***Immunities.*** You are immune to disease and cannot be put to sleep by magical means.

While in your Wild Shape form, your body is visibly artificial, with muscles replaced by root-like tendrils and reinforced by steel plates. It is clear to an observer that you are not a normal animal, but a unique blend of life and machine.

### Level 6: Implements of the Beast

You gain the ability to imbue your Wild Shape attacks with elemental power—charging your claws with electricity or unleashing flames from your fangs.

When you use Wild Shape, choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. While in Wild Shape, your attacks can deal the chosen damage type instead of their normal damage type.

When you use this ability on a creature, your attack has an additional effect, determined by which damage type you selected when you used Wild Shape.

***Acid.*** The target's AC is reduced by an amount equal to half your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) until the start of your next turn.

***Cold.*** The target's Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***Fire.*** The attack deals extra 1d8 Fire damage and a flammable object hit by this attack starts burning if it isn't being worn or carried.

***Lightning.*** The target's can't take Reactions until the start of your next turn.

***Thunder.*** The target has :d20-disadv: Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.
