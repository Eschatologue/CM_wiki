# Circle of the Forged

> *Union of Flesh and Steel*

What does it mean to be truly natural? Can a being made of wood and steel possess the spark of life? Druids of the Circle of the Forged challenge these boundaries, embracing the fusion of living creatures and machines. This circle represents a radical sect of druids who are deeply devoted to Valinor's generator-which they revere as the new form of their now gone Tree of Life. In their quest for greater attunement with their Omnissiah, whom they see as the embodiment of Harmony, they have replaced their own organic parts with mechanical augmentations.

### Level 3: Caretaker of Irminsul

You have attuned yourself to both nature and the spirits that presides inside machines, granting you the following benefits:

**Mending**{ .inl } You know the [:spell-lv-0: Mending] cantrip.

**Proficiency**{ .inl } You gain proficiency with Tinker's Tool or Smith's Tool, and one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice. You can use your Wisdom when you make ability checks using those tools.

### Level 3: Skin of Steel  

Through the fusion of ancient druidic techniques and advanced technology, you enhance your **:material-paw: Wild Shape** with mechanical augmentations, granting you the following benefits:

**Challenge Rating**{ .inl } The maximum Challenge Rating for the form equals your Druid level divided by 3 (round down).

**Armour Class**{ .inl } Your AC equals 13 plus your Wisdom modifier until you leave the form.

**Temporary Hit Points**{ .inl } You gain a number of **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to three times your Druid level.

Moreover, while in your Beast form, your body is visibly artificial, with muscles replaced by root-like tendrils and reinforced by metallic plates. It is clear to an observer that you are not a normal animal, but a unique blend of life and machine, you gain the following benefits:

**Creature Type**{ .inl } While in your Beast form, you're also considered a Construct in addition of the type of the creature you turn into. 

**Resistance**{ .inl } You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saves to gain and end the ^^Poisoned^^ condition, and you gain **:dmg-res: Resistance** to **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn } damage.

### Level 6: Implements of the Beast

You can transform the natural weapons of your **:material-paw: Wild Shape** form into fearsome, mechanical-like enhancements. For example, you might reshape claws into chainsaws, turn tails into bladed whips, or convert fangs into piercing drills.

After a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can choose a number of weapon [Mastery properties] (except **:wp-mas: Nick**{ .wp }) equal to half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down). While in your Beast form, when you make a melee attack or ranged attack that deals **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{ .dmg-phys }, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{ .dmg-phys }, or **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{ .dmg-phys } damage using one of the creature's feature, you can apply one of the chosen Mastery properties to that attack.

You may choose a new set of Mastery properties after each **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
