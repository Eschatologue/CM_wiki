# Circle of the Sea

> *Become One with Tides and Storms*


Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous natural forces of the world's oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature's wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil the natural world. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves, and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

### Level 3: Circle of the Sea Spells

Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

### Level 3: Wrath Of The Sea 

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can expend a use of your **:material-paw: Wild Shape** to manifest a 5-foot Emanation that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the Incapacitated condition.

When you manifest the Emanation and as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must suceed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

### Level 6: Aquatic Affinity

The sise of the Emanation created by your Wrath of the Sea increases to 10 feet.

In addition, you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

### Level 10: Stormborn

Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active:

**Flight**{ .inl } You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.

**Resistance**{ .inl } You have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-lgtn: Lightning, and :dmg-thun: Thunder damage.

### Level 14: Oceanic Gift

Instead of manifesting the Emanation Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of you. That creature gains all the benefits of the aura and uses your Spell Save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wildshape instead of one when manifesting it.
