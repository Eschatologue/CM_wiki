# Circle of the Sea

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous natural forces of the world’s oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature’s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil the natural world. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves, and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

## Level 3: Circle Spells

Your connection to this circle ensures that you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Druid Level | Spells Prepared |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | Fog Cloud, Gust of Wind, Ray of Frost, Shatter, Thunderwave |
| 5	| Sleet Storm, Lightning Bolt | 
| 7	| Control Water, Ice Storm |
| 9	| Conjure Elemental, Hold Monster |

## Level 3: Wrath Of The Sea 

As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest an aura that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you. The aura lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, dismiss it (no action required), or manifest the aura again.

At the end of each of your turns, you can choose another creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or take Thunder damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

## Level 6: Aquatic Affinity

You always have the Water Breathing spell prepared. In addition, you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed. If you use Wild Shape to assume a form that lacks a Swim Speed, that form gains your Swim Speed.

## Level 10: Stormborn

Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active:

- **Flight.** You gain a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.
- **Resistance.** You have resistance to Cold, Lighting, and Thunder damage.

## Level 14: Oceanic Gift

Whenever you use Wrath of the Sea, you can manifest the aura around one willing creature within 60 feet of you rather than manifesting it around yourself. The creature gains all the benefits of the aura and uses your Spell Save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the aura around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape, instead of one, when manifesting the aura.
