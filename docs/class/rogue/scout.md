# Scout

> *Skirmish with Speed and Skill*

You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. 

Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter â€” these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.

### Level 3: Skirmisher

You are difficult to pin down during a fight. When a creature Moves into a space within 5 feet of you or ends its turn there, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to Move up to half your Speed. This movement doesn't provoke :rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks.

Starting at level 5, you can move in this way when you use [Uncanny Dodge], as part of the same Reaction. 

### Level 3: Survivalist

You have proficiency and Expertise in the Nature and Survival skills. If you already have Expertise with either skill, you instead gain Expertise with a different skill with which you have proficiency in its place.

### Level 9: Superior Mobility

Your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } increases by 10 feet. If you have a Climb Speed or a Swim Speed, they also benefit from this increase. 

In addition, you no longer need to forgo any Sneak Attack dice in order to use the Withdraw option of your [Cunning Strike].

### Level 13: Ambush Master

You excel at leading ambushes and acting first in a fight. You have Advantage on Initiative rolls. In addition, the following effect is now among your [Cunning Strike] options.

**Ambush Strike (Cost: 1d6)**{ .inl } All attack rolls made against the target have Advantage until the start of your next turn. You can only use this option during the first round of a combat. 

### Level 17: Sudden Strike

You can strike with deadly speed. If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as a  **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }. This attack can benefit from your Sneak Attack even if you have already used it this turn, but you can't use your Sneak Attack against the same target more than once in a turn.
