# Saboteur

> *Demolish Targets with Explosives* 

Some rogues combine their various skills with an interest in alchemy to produce explosive effects. Known as Saboteurs, these strange alchemists have many specialties; demolition, siege warfare, entertainment. 

No matter their focus, they all delight in violent destruction, and due to the rarity of their talents, Saboteurs are invaluable allies or dangerous foes.

#### Cordite Charges 

At the end of each Short Rest, you can use your Alchemist's Supplies to create a number of Cordite Charges equal to your Proficiency Bonus. These Charges are used to craft explosives. Unused Cordite Charges or explosives made from them become inert and unusable at the end of your next Long Rest.

#### Explosives Known

You learn how to make three types of explosives; the [Basic Bomb](#basic-bomb), and two other explosives of your choice from the list at the end of this subclass description.

***Appearance.*** You can alter the outward appearance of an explosive. When they are unlit, creatures must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Explosive Save DC in order to recognize the object as an unlit explosive.

***Color.*** You alter the color of both explosive itself, the color of the explosion, and the color of the smoke it produces.

***Damage Type.*** You alter the damage type of any explosive you craft to :dmg-blunt: Bludgeoning, :dmg-piercing: Piercing, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-thunder: Thunder, or :dmg-lightning: Lightning.
