# Saboteur

> *Demolish Targets with Explosives* 

Some rogues combine their various skills with an interest in alchemy to produce explosive effects. Known as Saboteurs, these strange alchemists have many specialties; demolition, siege warfare, entertainment. 

No matter their focus, they all delight in violent destruction, and due to the rarity of their talents, Saboteurs are invaluable allies or dangerous foes.

### Level 3: Explosives

You gain a set with Alchemist's Supplies and profficiency with it, along with the secrets of creating explosives from Cordites:

#### Cordite Charges 

At the end of each Long Rest, you can use your Alchemist's Supplies to create a number of Cordite Charges equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). These Charges are used to craft explosives. Unused Cordite Charges or explosives made from them become inert and unusable at the end of your next Long Rest.

#### Explosives Known

You learn how to make three types of explosives; the [Basic Bomb](#basic-bomb), and two other explosives of your choice from the list at the end of this subclass description.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one explosive you know with another explosive of your choice.

You learn to craft two additional explosives of your choice when you reach level 9 (total of five), 13 (total of seven), and 17 (total of nine) in this class.

#### Using Explosives 

A creature can take the :rsc-a: **Utilise** action to throw one of your Saboteur Explosives at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. It explodes on impact, generating the effects in its description centered on the point of impact.

#### Explosive Save DC

Some of your explosives require your target to make a saving throw to resist their explosive effects. Your Explosive Save DC is ^^8 plus your Intelligence modifier and your Proficiency Bonus^^.

### Level 3: Destructive Strikes

Your work has given you a knack for identifying structural weak points. You gain the following benefits:

***Weakness Exploit.*** When you hit a non-magical structure with a weapon attack or one of your explosives, it is considered a Critical Hit.

***Improved Critical.*** when you attack a Construct, the number you need to roll for Critical Hit is reduced by 1. This Critical Hit reduction can stack.

### Level 9: Advanced Alchemy

Your mastery of alchemy allows you to alter the explosives you make in the following ways:

***Appearance.*** You can alter the outward appearance of an explosive. When they are unlit, creatures must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your Explosive Save DC in order to recognize the object as an unlit explosive.

***Color.*** You alter the color of both explosive itself, the color of the explosion, and the color of the smoke it produces.

***Damage Type.*** You alter the damage type of any explosive you craft to :dmg-blunt: Bludgeoning, :dmg-piercing: Piercing, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-thunder: Thunder, or :dmg-lightning: Lightning.

### Level 17: Hair Trigger
