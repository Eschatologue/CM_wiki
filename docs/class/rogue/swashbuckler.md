# Swashbuckler

As a Swashbuckler, you focus on the art of the blade, bringing speed, elegance, and charm to your combat style—topped off with an exquisite flourish of panache. You excel in single combat, and your methods make a duel look like a flamboyant performance.

## Fancy Footwork – Level 3

You’ve learned how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. If you make a melee attack against a creature during your turn, that creature can’t make Opportunity Attacks against you for the rest of that turn.

## Suave Defence – Level 3

While you aren’t wearing any armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.
 
## Rakish Audacity – Level 3

When you roll Initiative, you can give yourself a bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don’t need Advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

## Panache – Level 9

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

- **Goad (Cost: 1d6)**

    The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or until the end of its next turn, the target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can’t make Opportunity Attacks against targets other than you.

- **Awe (Cost: 3d6)**

    Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition until the end of your next turn.

## Dashing Strikes – Level 13

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

- **Parrying Stance (Cost: 2d6)**

    Roll a d6. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled.

- **Invigorate (Cost: 2d6)**

    Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Until the end of that creature’s next turn, whenever it makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

## Master Duelist – Level 17

Immediately after you use your Sneak Attack, you can make another attack against the same target, provided you are within 5 feet of it and no other creatures are within 5 feet of you.
