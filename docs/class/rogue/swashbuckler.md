# Swashbuckler

> *Delivers Deadly Strikes with Speed and Panache*

As a Swashbuckler, you focus on the art of the blade, bringing speed, elegance, and charm to your combat styleâ€”topped off with an exquisite flourish of panache. You excel in single combat, and your methods make a duel look like a flamboyant performance.

### Level 3: Fancy Footwork

You've learned how to land a strike then slip away without reprisal. If you make a melee attack against a creature during your turn, that creature can't make :rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks against you for the rest of that turn. 
 
### Level 3: Rakish Audacity

You have honed your skills in one to one battles with brash confidence.

***Initiative.***{ .sc } You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .em } on Initiative rolls.

***Dueling.***{ .sc } You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .em } on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have **:d20-disadv: Disadvantage**{ .em } on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you. 

### Level 3: Suave Defence

Your brash confidence allows you to avoid harm. While you aren't wearing any armour or wielding a Shield, your base Armour Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

### Level 9: Panache

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

***Goad (Cost: 1d6).***{ .sc } The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or until the end of its next turn, the target has **:d20-disadv: Disadvantage**{ .em } on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make :rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks against targets other than you.

***Awe (Cost: 3d6).***{ .sc } Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the ^^Charmed^^ condition until the end of your next turn.

### Level 13: Dashing Strikes

You have practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

***Parrying Stance (Cost: 2d6).***{ .sc } Roll a :die-d6: d6. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to the number rolled.

***Invigorate (Cost: 2d6).***{ .sc } Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Until the end of that creature's next turn, whenever it makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

### Level 17: Master Duelist

Immediately after you use your Sneak Attack, you can make another attack against the same target, provided you are within 5 feet of it and no other creatures are within 5 feet of you.
