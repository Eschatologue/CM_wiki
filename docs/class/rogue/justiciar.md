# Justiciar

> *Purge the heretics. Silence the blasphemers. Let the faithless tremble.*
 
Not all servants of the gods work in the light. Justiciars are zealous enforcers of divine will; ruthless at rooting out heresy and crushing the faithless. Operating in shadows and answering only to their god, they use any means necessary to ensure no sin goes unpunished. Faith drives them, terror follows them, and judgement is their blade.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity

You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your god, and can use it to fuel magical effects. You start with two such divine effect, Divine Sense and Shroud of Faith.

You can use Channel Divinity once. You regain one expended use when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Rogue levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the [Justiciar Spellcasting table].

**Divine Sense**{ .inl } As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [:spell-lv5: Hallow] spell.

**Shroud of Faith**{ .inl } As an :rsc-b: Bonus action, you grip your holy symbol and invoke the protection of your god. You have the ^^Invisible^^ condition for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

### Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. The information below details how you use those rules as a Justiciar.

#### Cantrips

You know three cantrips: [:spell-lv0: True Strike] and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Cleric spell list]. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except [:spell-lv0: True Strike], with another cantrip of your choice from the [Cleric spell list].

When you reach level 10 in this class, you learn another Cleric cantrip of your choice.

#### Spell Slots

The [Justiciar Spellcasting table] shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Cleric spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Justiciar Spellcasting table]. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Cleric spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the [Justiciar Spellcasting table]. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Cleric spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

#### Changing your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the [Cleric spell list]. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:ability-cha: **Charisma** is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this subclass.

### Level 3: Zealous Ire

You and your weapons are blessed by the heavens to smite heretics and blasphemers, giving you the following benefits:

**Bonus Proficiency**{ .inl } You gain proficiency with the Religion skill. Whenever you would make an Intelligence (Religion) check, you can choose to make a Charisma (Religion) check instead.

**Concecrated Weapons**{ .inl } As part of a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can perform a ritual and touch a weapon that you are proficient with to Consecrate it. This Consecrated weapon becomes a Holy Symbol and can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Cleric spells. You can also add your Sneak Attack bonus to attacks with it even if it does not have the :weapon-prop-finesse: Finesse property. However, all other rules of for Sneak Attack bonus still apply. You can have only one Consecrated weapon at a time.

### Level 9: Wrathful Strikes

When you hit a creature with an attack that includes Sneak Attack damage, you can expend a level 1+ spell slot to empower your strike with divine judgment. The additional damage from your Sneak Attack becomes :dmg-radi: Radiant or :dmg-necr: Necrotic damage (choose each time), and you can treat any 1 or 2 on the Sneak Attack damage roll as a 3.

### Level 13: Divine Step

You have the [:spell-lv2: Misty Step] spell always prepared. When you cast this spell, you can make one weapon attack or cast [:spell-lv0: True Strike] with as part of the same action of casting [:spell-lv2: Misty Step]. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on this attack.

### Level 17: Will of the Gods

When you roll **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } with no uses of your Channel Divinity remaining, you instantly regain one expended use. Moreover, whenever you are Concentrating on a Cleric spell and forced to make a saving throw, you gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).
