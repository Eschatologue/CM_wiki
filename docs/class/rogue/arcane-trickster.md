# Arcane Trickster

> *Enhance Stealth with Arcane Spells*
 
As quick with a spell as you are with a lockpick, your illusions and enchantments keep opponents on the back foot.

Some Rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with Arcane spells, learning magical tricks to aid them in their trade. Some Arcane Tricksters use their talents as pickpockets and burglars, while others are pranksters, mischief-makers, or adventurers.

### Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.

| 20 | 13 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |

#### Cantrips

You know three cantrips: [:spell-lv0: Mage Hand] and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Wizard spell list]. Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except [:spell-lv0: Mage Hand], with another cantrip of your choice from the [Wizard spell list].

When you reach level 10 in this class, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

#### Spell Slots

The [Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table] shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of level 1 and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table]. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the [Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table]. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

#### Changing your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the [Wizard spell list]. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:abl-int: **Intelligence** is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this subclass.

### Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain

When you cast [:spell-lv0: Mage Hand], you can make the spectral hand invisible. You can control the hand as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, instead of an action, and through it, you can use Thieves' Tools and make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

### Level 9: Magical Ambush

If you have the ^^Invisible^^ condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.

### Level 13: Versatile Trickster

You gain the ability to distract targets with your Mage Hand. When you use the *Disarm* or *Trip* options of your Cunning Strike, you can also target that option at a creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

### Level 17: Spell Thief

You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.

Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can't cast it until the 8 hours have passed.

Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can't use this feature again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
