# Soulknife

> *Strike Foes with Psionic Blades*

Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use Thieves' Tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.

### Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which fuel various psionic powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Enerdy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.

##### Soulknife Energy Dice

| Rogue Level | Die Size | Number |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 3 | :die-d6: **D6** | 4 |
| 5 | :die-d8: **D8** | 6 |
| 9 | :die-d8: **D8** | 8 |
| 11 | :die-d10: **D10** | 8 |
| 13 | :die-d10: **D10** | 10 |
| 17 | :die-d12: **D12** | 12 |

Any features in this sublass that usea Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die as specified in a power;s description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a dice when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.

You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Die when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all of them when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

**Psi-Bolstered Knack**{.inl} If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll them succeeds.

**Psychic Whispers**{.inl} You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others â€” perfect for quiet infiltration. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.

The first time you use this power after each Long Rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy Die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.

### Level 3: Psychic Blades

You can manifest your psionic power as shimmering blades of psychic energy. Whenever you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, you can manifest a psychic blade from your free hand and make the attack with that blade. The magic blade has traits in the Psychic Blades table.

##### Psychic Blades

| Trait | Details |
|---|---|
| **Weapon Category** | Simple Melee |
| **Base Damage** | **1d6 + Ability Modifier :dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } |
| **Properties** | :wp-prop-finesse: ^^Finesse^^, :wp-prop-thrown: ^^Thrown (20/60)^^ | 
| **Mastery** | Vex (you can use this property, and it doesn't count against the number of properties you can use with Weapon Mastery) |

The blade vanishses immediately after it hits or misses its target, and leaves no mark if it deals damage.

After you attack with the blade, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack with a second psychic blade as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on the same turn, provided your other hand is free to create it. The damage die of this bonus attack is 1d4, instead of 1d6.

### Level 9: Soul Blades

Your Psychic Blades are now an expression of your psi-suffused soul, giving you these powers that use your Psionic Energy dice:

**Homing Strikes**{.inl} If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.

**Psychic Teleportation**{.inl} As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.

### Level 13: Psychic Veil

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you gain the **Invisible**{ .cond } condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss this effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest** unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 17: Rend Mind

*You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature's mind.*

When you use your Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the Stunned condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest** unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.
