# Assassin

> *Practice the Grim Art of Death*

You prefer to deliver sublime punishment to a single target at a time â€” not in a duel, of course, because a duel implies chivalry, and you're far too busy getting the job done to bother with honour. As an **Assassin**, you are trained in the grim art of death, using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate your foes with ruthless precision. Whether you're a hired killer, a spy, a bounty hunter, or simply an adventurer with a practical mindset, your skills are built for swift, efficient execution.

### Level 3: Assassinate

You are adept at getting the drop on a target, granting you the following benefits:

**Initiative**{.inl} You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } rolls.

**Surprising Strikes**{.inl} During the first round of each combat, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. If your Sneak Attack hits any target during that round, the target takes extra damage of the weapon's type equal to your Rogue level.

### Level 3: Assassin's Tools

You gain proficiency with the Disguise Kit and Poisoner's Kit.
 
### Level 9: Infiltration Expertise

You are expert at the following techniques that aid your infiltrations.

**Masterful Mimicry**{.inl} You can unerringly mimic another person's speech, handwriting, or both. if you have spent at least 1 hour studying them.

**Roving Aim**{.inl} Your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } isn't reduced to 0 by using [Steady Aim](index.md#level-3-steady-aim).

### Level 13: Envenom Weapons

When you use the Poison option of your Cunning Strike, the target also takes **2d6 :dmg-posn: Poison**{.dmg-posn} damage whenever it fails the saving throw. This damage ignores **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to **:dmg-posn: Poison**{.dmg-posn} damage.

### Level 17: Death Strike

When you hit with your Sneak Attack on the first round of a combat, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency Bonus), or the attack's damage is doubled against the target.
