# Path of the Storm Herald

> *Tap into the Roiling Storm Within*

Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.

Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect the natural realm. Other storm heralds hone their craft in elite lodges founded in regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the world's end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

### Level 3: Storm Aura

While your Rage is active, a storm whips around you in a 10 foot Emanation. As part of the Bonus Action you use to activate or maintain your Rage, you can cause one of the following effects. You choose which when you activate your Rage. If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus and your Strength modifier.

***Desert.*** All other creatures within the Emanation take :dmg-fire: Fire damage equal to 1d4 plus your Rage Damage bonus.

***Sea.*** You choose one other creature you can see within the Emanation. It must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, it takes :dmg-lightning: Lightning damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier and half as much on a successful save. This damage increases by 1d6 at level 10, level 15, and at level 20.

***Tundra.*** Each creature of your choice within the Emanation gains Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d4 plus your Rage Damage bonus, which last until your Rage ends.

### Level 6: Storm Soul

The storm grants you benefits even when your Storm Aura isn't active. Whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest choose one of the following effects, which lasts until you finish your next Short or Long Rest:

***Desert.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-fire: Fire damage and you don't suffer effects caused by extreme heat, and as an action you can touch a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried by anyone else and set it on fire.

***Sea.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-lightning: Lightning damage, you can breathe underwater, and you have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

***Tundra.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-cold: Cold damage and you don't suffer effects caused by extreme cold, and as an action you can touch a 5-foot Cube of water and turn it into ice, which melts after 1 minute. This action fails if a creature is in the Cube.

### Level 10: Shielding Storm

You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others. Each creature of your choice has :dmg-res: Resistance to the damage type of your Storm Soul feature while it is within your Storm Aura.

### Level 14: Raging Storm

The power of your Storm Aura grows mightier, lashing out at your foes.

***Desert.*** Immediately after a creature within the Emanation hits you with an attack, you can use your Reaction to force that creature to make a Dexterity save. On a failed save, the creature takes :dmg-fire: Fire damage equal to your Barbarian level.

***Sea.*** When you hit a creature within the Emanation with an attack, you can use your Reaction to force that creature to make a Strength save. On a failed save, the creature takes an extra 2d6 :dmg-cold: Cold damage and has the Prone condition.

***Tundra.*** Whenever you activate the effect of your Storm Aura, you choose one creature you can see within the Emanation. That creature must succeed on a Strength save, or has its Speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.
