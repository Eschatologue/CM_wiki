# Path of the Battlerager

> *Assail Grappled Enemies with Spiked Armor*

Often followers of gods of war, these furious Barbarians pride themselves in very close combat. They adorn their armor with metal pins and spikes that pierce a foe upon contact. These Barbarians often fight bare handed, preferring to instead grab and wrestle with their enemies as their armor pokes bleeding holes in them.

### Level 3: Ravager Armor

You adorn your armor with crude spikes with which you can slam your enemies. You gain a set of Smith's Tools and you have proficiency with them. You can spend 1 minute using the Smith's Tools to turn a set of Light or Medium Armor into your Ravager Armor, fastening metal spikes to it. 

While wearing your Ravager Armor, you gain the following benefits:

**Barbed**{ .inl } You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Grappled condition.

***Spiked Slam***. When you make an Unarmed Strike (Damage), you can slam into the target with your armor, dealing :dmg-prcg: Piercing damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage for an Unarmed Strike.

**Spiky Embrace**{ .inl } At the start of each of your turns while you have a creature Grappled, it takes :dmg-prcg: Piercing damage equal to your Strength modifier (minimum 1 damage).

### Level 3: Ravager's Hold

Your furious grip becomes extremely tight as you press your spiked armor into your enemies. When your **:class-abl-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you gain the following benefits:

**Tight Grip**{ .inl } You add your **:class-abl-rage: Rage**{ .em } Damage bonus to the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes.

**Raging Hold**{ .inl } You add your **:class-abl-rage: Rage**{ .em } Damage bonus to the damage of your Spiky Embrace.

### Level 6: Spiked Retribution

When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make an Unarmed Strike against it. This Unarmed Strike can only be used to Grapple.

### Level 10: Death Roll

While your **:class-abl-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, you can use your **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to perform a Death Roll. You move yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you, dragging the Grappled creatures along with you. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. During this movement, you violently spin and slam your Grappled targets around you, dealing 2d8 :dmg-prcg: Piercing damage to each target. The damage increases by 1d8 at level 15 (3d8) and at level 20 (4d8).

### Level 14: Ravager's Might

Once per turn, while your **:class-abl-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, you can forgo one of your attacks to use the Grappled creature as a weapon, provided the creature is the same size as you or smaller and you have nothing in your hands. You choose one of the following options:

**Roundhouse Sweep**{ .inl } You spin one of the Grappled creatures around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. The Grappled creature takes 2d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage.

**Seismic Toss**{ .inl } You throw one of the Grappled creatures at a target you can see within 20 feet of you. The Grappled creature and the target make a Strength save (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage and has the Prone condition.
