# Path of the Battlerager

> *Assail Grappled Enemies with Spiked Armour*

Often followers of gods of war, these furious Barbarians pride themselves in very close combat. They adorn their armour with metal pins and spikes that pierce a foe upon contact. These Barbarians often fight bare handed, preferring to instead grab and wrestle with their enemies as their armour pokes bleeding holes in them.

### Level 3: Ravager Armour

You adorn your armour with crude spikes with which you can slam your enemies. You gain a set of Smith's Tools and you have proficiency with them. You can spend 1 minute using the Smith's Tools to turn a set of Light or Medium Armour into your Ravager Armour, fastening metal spikes to it. 

While wearing your Ravager Armour, you gain the following benefits:

**Barbed**{.inl} You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saving throws to avoid or end the Grappled condition.

**Spiked Slam**{.inl} When you make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike (Damage)**{ .rsc }, you can slam into the target with your armour, dealing **(1d6 + Strength modifier) :dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps} damage, instead of the normal damage for an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }.

**Spiky Embrace**{.inl} At the start of each of your turns while you have a creature Grappled, it takes **(Strength modifier) :dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps} damage (minimum 1 damage). When your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you add your Rage damage bonus to this damage.

### Level 3: Ravager's Hold

Your furious grip becomes extremely tight as you press your spiked armour into your enemies. When your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you add your Rage Damage bonus to the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes.

### Level 6: Spiked Retribution

When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } against it. This **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } can only be used to Grapple.

### Level 10: Death Roll

While your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, perform a *Death Roll*. 

**Death Roll**{.inl} As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you move yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you, dragging the Grappled creatures along with you. During this Movement, you violently spin and slam your Grappled target, dealing **1d6 :dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps} damage for each 5 feet you move. The damage increases by `1d6` at level 15 (`2d6`) and at level 20 (`3d6`).

### Level 14: Ravager's Might

Once per turn, while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, you can forgo one of your attacks to use the Grappled creature as a weapon, provided the creature is the same size as you or smaller and you have nothing in your hands. If an effect imposes a Saving Throw, it uses your Unarmed Strike's DC.

You choose one of the following options:

**Roundhouse Sweep**{ .inl } You spin one of the Grappled creatures around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20}. On a failed save, a creature takes **3d6 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. The Grappled creature takes **2d6 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage.

**Seismic Toss**{ .inl } You throw one of the Grappled creatures at a target you can see within 20 feet of you. The Grappled creature and the target make a **:d20-save: STR Save**{.d20}. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d6 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage and has the Prone condition.
