# Path of the Battlerager

> *Assail Grappled Enemies with Spiked Armour*

Often followers of gods of war, these furious Barbarians pride themselves in very close combat. They adorn their armour with metal pins and spikes that pierce a foe upon contact. These Barbarians often fight bare handed, preferring to instead grab and wrestle with their enemies as their armour pokes bleeding holes in them.

### Level 3: Ravager Armour

You adorn your armour with crude spikes with which you can slam your enemies. You gain a set of Smith's Tools and you have proficiency with them. You can spend 1 minute using the Smith's Tools to turn a set of Light or Medium Armour into your Ravager Armour, fastening metal spikes to it. 

While wearing your Ravager Armour, you gain the following benefits:

**Barbed**{.inl} You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saving throws to avoid or end the Grappled condition.

**Spiked Slam**{.inl} When you make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike (Damage)**{ .rsc }, you can slam into the target with your armour, dealing **1d6 plus Strength modifier :dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps}, instead of the normal damage for an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }.

**Spiky Embrace**{.inl} At the start of each of your turns while you have a creature Grappled, it takes **(Strength modifier) :dmg-prcg: Piercing** damage (minimum 1 damage).

### Level 3: Ravager's Hold

Your furious grip becomes extremely tight as you press your spiked armour into your enemies. When your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you gain the following benefits:

**Tight Grip**{.inl} You add your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } Damage bonus to the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes.

**Raging Hold**{.inl} You add your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } Damage bonus to the damage of your Spiky Embrace.

### Level 6: Spiked Retribution

When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } against it. This **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } can only be used to Grapple.

### Level 10: Death Roll

While your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, you can use your **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to perform a *Death Roll*. You move yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you, dragging the Grappled creatures along with you. This Movement doesn't provoke **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**{.rsc}. During this Movement, you violently spin and slam your Grappled targets around you, dealing **2d8 :dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps} damage to each target. The damage increases by `1d8` at level 15 (`3d8`) and at level 20 (`4d8`).

### Level 14: Ravager's Might

Once per turn, while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and you have one or more creatures Grappled, you can forgo one of your attacks to use the Grappled creature as a weapon, provided the creature is the same size as you or smaller and you have nothing in your hands. You choose one of the following options:

**Roundhouse Sweep**{ .inl } You spin one of the Grappled creatures around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20} (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes **3d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. The Grappled creature takes **2d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage.

**Seismic Toss**{ .inl } You throw one of the Grappled creatures at a target you can see within 20 feet of you. The Grappled creature and the target make a Strength save (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage and has the Prone condition.
