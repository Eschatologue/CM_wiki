# Path of Tranquilty

> *Forge Serenity into Unstoppable Force - Written by Eschatologue*

For Barbarians who walk the Path of Tranquillity, Rage is a bottomless well of calm and reason. They draw upon this power to achieve extraordinary focus in battle and they channel this clarity into devastating effects.

### Level 3: Combat Superiority

You have studied martial techniques to enhance your skill in battle. You learn Manoeuvre from the Fighter's Battle Master subclass that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.

#### Manoeuvre

You learn two different Manoeuvre of your choice from the "[Manoeuvre Options]" section from the Battle Master subclass. Many Manoeuvre enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one Manoeuvre per attack.

You learn two additional Manoeuvre of your choice when you reach Barbarian level 6, 10, and 14. Each time you learn new Manoeuvre, you can also replace one Manoeuvre you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice

You have three Superiority Dice, which are :die-d6: d6s. A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest.

You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Barbarian level 6 (four dice total) and 14 (five dice total)

#### Saving Throws

If a Manoeuvre requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength modifier.

### Level 3: Dead Calm

You enter a state of heightened focus when you Rage. While your Rage is active, the Frightened and Charmed conditions on you are suppressed. When your Rage ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

### Level 6: Battle Focus

When you activate your Rage, you can choose one of the following benefits:

***Restoration.*** You regain one of your expended Superiority Dice.
  
***Temporary Hit Points.*** You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to one roll of your Superiority Die.
 
***Improved Speed.*** Opportunity Attack against you have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** and your :rsc-speed: Speed is doubled for your current turn.

### Level 6: Improved Superiority

Your Superiority Die becomes a :die-d8: **d8**.

### Level 10: Relentless and Unstopable

Your seething fury is unstopable. You gain the following benefits:

***Freedom of Movement.*** While your Rage is active, your movement is unaffected by Difficult Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your Speed nor cause you to have the Paralyzed or Restrained conditions.

***Fighting Style.*** You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice, but can only benefit from it while your Rage is active. You can change this Fighting Style feat whenever you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 10: Masterful Superiority

Your Superiority Die becomes a :die-d10: **d10**.

### Level 14: Flurry of Steel

Once per turn, when your Rage is active, you can roll a **d6** in place of expending a Superiority Die. This d6 is not affected by any features that improve your Superiority Die.
