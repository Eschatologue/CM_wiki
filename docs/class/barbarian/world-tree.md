# Path of the World Tree

*Trace the Roots and Branches of the World*

Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree believe that their Rage links them to the cosmic ash tree Yggdrasil. This “world tree” grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and to the many worlds of the Material Plane, and the greatest plants on every world are said to be distant descendants of mighty Yggdrasil. These Barbarians draw on their connection to the world tree as a source of vitality and as a means of travel across the multiverse.

### Level 3: Vitality of the Tree

Your Rage taps into the lifeforce of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits: 

***Vitality Surge.*** When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level. 

***Life-Giving Force.*** At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your Rage ends, they vanish. 

### Level 6: Branches of the Tree

Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Level 10: Battering Roots

Tendrils of the World Tree extend from your Melee weapons. During your turn, while you wield a Melee weapon with the Heavy or Versatile property, your reach with that weapon increases by 10 feet. When you hit with this weapon, you can activate the Push or Topple property in addition to any other Mastery property you are using with that weapon.

### Level 14: Travel Along the Tree

You can briefly travel along the World Tree. When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus Action while it's active, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 

In addition, once oer Rage, you can increase the range of that teleport to 150 feet, When you do so, you can also bring up to six willing creatures who are within 10 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.
