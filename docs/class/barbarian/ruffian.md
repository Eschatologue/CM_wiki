# Path of the Ruffian

> *Rage Born in the Streets*

While most Barbarians draw their Rage from the untamed wilderness, those who follow the Path of the Ruffian find their Rage in the shadowy underbelly of civilisation, in the slums of sprawling cities and among the forgotten corners of society. Unlike others who fight for honour or noble causes, a Ruffian battles for the thrill of it—or simply to survive another day. Whatever drives them, Ruffians share one thing in common: when trouble arises, they prefer to settle matters with their fists.

### Level 3: The Wrong Crowd

You have a way of connecting with the less savoury members of society. 

You can speak, read, and write Thieves' Cant. Additionally, whenever you make an ability check when interacting with those who understand Thieves' Cant—such as criminals, rogues, or other disreputable figures—your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Level 3: Bruiser's Might

Your body itself has become a weapon. You gain the [Unarmed Fighting](../../option/feat/feat-fighting-style/phb24.md#unarmed-fighting) Fighting Style feat.

Additionally, while you aren't wearing Medium or Heavy armour, you gain the following benefits:

***Bonus Unarmed Strike.*** You can make an Unarmed Strike as a :rsc-b: Bonus Action.

***Climbing Speed.*** You gain a Climbing Speed equal to your :rsc-speed: Speed.

***Quick Jab.*** When you activate your Rage, you can make an Unarmed Strike as part of the same :rsc-b: Bonus Action.

### Level 6: Forceful Rend

Your fists becomes devastating to whoever at the receiving end. Your Unarmed Strike is improved in the following ways:

***Hurl.*** As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can end a Grapple to throw the creature to a point you can see within 30 feet. If the creature lands in an unoccupied space, it has the ^^Prone^^ condition. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + Prof. Bonus + Str. modifier) or take :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage equal to your Unarmed Strike damage.

***Concussion.*** When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + Prof. Bonus + Str. modifier). On a failure, it has the ^^Stunned^^ condition until the start of your next turn. On a success, its Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack against it has :d20-adv: Advantage.

You can use this class feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Level 10: Crushing Strength

Your expertise in hand-to-hand combat reaches new heights: your unarmed attacks are deadlier and more punishing. While your Rage is active, you gain the following benefits:

***Backbreaker.*** At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can deal 1d6 :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning damage to one creature that receive the ^^Grappled^^ condition from you, instead of 1d4. At Barbarial level 14, this damage die becomes 1d8.

***Deadly Strikes.*** While your Rage is active, when you do damage with Unarmed Strike, its damage die becomes 1d8, or 1d10 if you have two free hands. At Barbarian level 14, this damage die becomes 1d10, or 1d12 if you have two free hands.

### Level 10: Titan's Grip

Once you have a hold of something it is nearly impossible for it to escape. You gain the following benefit:

***Improved Grappling.*** The size of creatures that you can Grapple increases by one size. When you Grapple a creature more than one size larger than you, its :rsc-speed: Speed is halved, but you move with it so long as there is an unoccupied space adjacent to it.

***No Speed Reduction.*** While you are moving or dragging a Grappled creature that is one size larger than you or smaller, your :rsc-speed: Speed isn't reduced.

### Level 14: Unyielding

You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Death Saving Throw, you roll a d6 and add it to your roll.

Should you roll a 20 or higher on a Death Saving Throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with 1 Hit Point.
