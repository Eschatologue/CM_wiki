# Path of the Ruffian

While most Barbarians draw their Rage from the untamed wilderness, those who follow the Path of the Ruffian find their Rage in the shadowy underbelly of civilisation, in the slums of sprawling citadel cities and among the forgotten corners of society. Unlike others who fight for honour or noble causes, a Ruffian battles for the thrill of it—or simply to survive another day. Whatever drives them, Ruffians share one thing in common: when trouble arises, they prefer to settle matters with their fists.

### Level 3: The Wrong Crowd

You have a way of connecting with the less savoury members of society. 

You can speak, read, and write Thieves' Cant. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with those who understand Thieves' Cant—such as criminals, rogues, or other disreputable figures—your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

### Level 3: Bruiser's Might

Your body itself has become a weapon. You gain the [Unarmed Fighting Style](../../character-creation/feat/feat-fighting-style.md#unarmed-fighting) feat. This feat can't be replaced.

Additionally, while you aren't wearing any Light, Medium or Heavy armour, you gain the following benefits:

***Bonus Unarmed Strike.*** You can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

***Climbing Speed.*** You gain a Climbing Speed equal to your Speed.

***Quick Jab.*** When you activate your Rage, you can make an Unarmed Strike as part of the same Bonus Action.

### Level 6: Ruthless Combatant

Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed Strike, it can deal your choice of :dmg-force: Force damage or its normal damage type. Moreover, whenever a creature within your reach hit or miss an attack roll against you, you can take a :rsc-reaction: Reaction and make one Unarmed Strike against it.

### Level 6: Forceful Rend

While your Rage is active, your Unarmed Strike is improved in the following ways:

***Hurl.*** When a creature is Grappled by you, you can choose to end that Grapple throw the creature to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature lands in an unoccupied space it gains the Prone condition. But, if it hits another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity save (DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier) or take Bludgeoning damage equal to your Unarmed Strike damage.

***Concussion.*** When you damage a creature with Unarmed Strike, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Stunned condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target's Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has Advantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Level 10: Improved Unarmed Fighting

You gain the following benefits:

***Backbreaker.*** At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can deal 1d6 Bludgeoning damage to one creature that receive the Grappled condition from you, instead of 1d4. **At level 14**, this damage die becomes 1d8.

***Improved Damage.*** While your Rage is active, when you do damage with Unarmed Strike, its damage die becomes 1d8, or 1d10 if you have two free hands. **At level 14**, this damage die becomes 1d10, or 1d12 if you have two free hands.

### Level 10: Titan's Grip

Once you have a hold of something it is nearly impossible for it to escape. You gain the following benefit:

***Improved Grappling.*** The size of creatures that you can Grapple increases by one size. When you Grapple a creature more than one size larger than you, its :rsc-speed: Speed is halved, but you move with it so long as there is an unoccupied space adjacent to it.

***No Speed Reduction.*** While you are moving or dragging a Grappled creature that is one size larger than you or smaller, your :rsc-speed: Speed isn't reduced.

### Level 14: Unyielding

You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Death Saving Throw, you roll a d6 and add it to your roll.

Should you roll a 20 or higher on a Death Saving Throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with 1 Hit Point.
