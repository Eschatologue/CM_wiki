# Path of the Ruffian

> *Rage Born in the Streets*

While most Barbarians draw their Rage from the untamed wilderness, those who follow the Path of the Ruffian find their **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } in the shadowy underbelly of civilisation, in the slums of sprawling cities and among the forgotten corners of society. Unlike others who fight for honour or noble causes, a Ruffian battles for the thrill of it—or simply to survive another day. Whatever drives them, Ruffians share one thing in common: when trouble arises, they prefer to settle matters with their fists.

### Level 3: The Wrong Crowd

You have a way of connecting with the less savoury members of society. 

You can speak, read, and write Thieves' Cant. Additionally, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} whenever you make Charisma check when interacting with those who understand Thieves' Cant—such as criminals, rogues, or other disreputable figures.

### Level 3: Bruiser's Might

Your body itself has become a weapon, while you aren't wearing Medium or Heavy armour, you gain the following benefits:

**Ruffian's Fist**{.inl} You can roll `1d6` in place of the normal damage of your **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{.rsc}. This die changes at certain Barbarian level; `1d8` at level 6, `1d10` at level 10, and finally `1d12` at level 12.

**Bonus Unarmed Strike**{.inl} You can make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{.rsc} as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}.

**Climbing Speed**{.inl} You gain a Climbing Speed equal to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em }.

**Quick Jab**{.inl} When you activate your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }, you can make one **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{.rsc} as part of the same **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}.

### Level 6: Forceful Rend

Your fists becomes devastating to whoever at the receiving end. The following options are added to your **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{.rsc}:

**Concussion**{.inl} You can force a creature you hit with **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike (Damage)**{.rsc} to make a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20}. On fail, the target must subtract the result of your Unarmed Strike die from its next D20 Test until the start of your next turn.

**Hurl**{.inl} As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}, you can end a **Grapple** to throw the creature to a point you can see within 20 feet. If the creature lands in an unoccupied space, it has the **Prone**{.cond} condition. If it collides with another creature, that creature must succeed on a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20} or take **(Unarmed Strike) :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage.

### Level 10: Backbreaker

Your expertise in hand-to-hand combat reaches new heights. 

At the start of each of your turns while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you can deal **(Rage Damage) :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps} damage to one creature that receive the **Grappled**{.cond} condition from you (no action required).

### Level 10: Titan's Grip

Once you have a hold of something it is nearly impossible for it to escape. You gain the following benefit:

**Improved Grappling**{.inl} The size of creatures that you can Grapple increases by one size. When you Grapple a creature more than one size larger than you, its **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } is halved, but you move with it so long as there is an unoccupied space adjacent to it.

**No Speed Reduction**{.inl} While you are moving or dragging a Grappled creature that is one size larger than you or smaller, your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } isn't reduced.

### Level 14: Unyielding

You can shrug off physical blows that would devastate lesser warriors. When you make a Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or Death Saving Throw, you roll a d6 and add it to your roll.

Should you roll a 22 or higher on a Death Saving Throw, you instantly regain consciousness and stand up with a number of Hit Points equals to half your Barbarian level.
