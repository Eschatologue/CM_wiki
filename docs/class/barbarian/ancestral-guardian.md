# Path of the Ancestral Guardian

> *Defend your Allies with Ancestral Spirits*

Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These traditions teach that the honoured spirits of the past linger in the world, guiding and protecting the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, they reach into the spirit world, calling upon their ancestors for aid.

Barbarians who draw upon their ancestral guardians embody the strength and virtues of their forebears, fighting to protect their kin and allies. To honour their ancestors, they often inscribe their bodies with intricate markings that recount their lineage's deeds. These symbols tell tales of battles against monstrous foes, triumphs over rival clans, and the wisdom of generations past.

### Level 3: Ancestral Protectors

Spectral warriors appear when you enter your Rage. While your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn becomes the target of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that target has :d20-disadv: Disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you, and when the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has :dmg-res: Resistance to the damage of the attack. The effect on the target ends early if your Rage ends.

### Level 6: Spirit Shield

The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection to those you defend. While your Rage is active and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your :rsc-r: Reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6. The damage reduction increases by an extra 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and level 14 (4d6).

### Level 10: Consult the Spirits

You gain the ability to consult with your ancestral spirits. You can cast the [:spell-lv2: Augury](../../spells/description/core/level-2.md#augury) or [:spell-lv2: Clairvoyance](../../spells/description/core/level-3.md#clairvoyance) spell without using a spell slot or material components. :ability-wis: Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. After you cast either spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Level 14: Vengeful Ancestors

Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate. When you use your Spirit Shield to reduce the damage of an attack, the attacker takes the same amount of :dmg-force: Force damage.
