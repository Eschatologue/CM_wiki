Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a :rsc-b: Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armour.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

***Damage Resistance.*** You have :dmg-res: **Resistance** to :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning, :dmg-prcg: Piercing, and :dmg-slsh: Slashing damage.

***Rage Damage.*** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

***Strength Advantage.*** You have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

***No Concentration or Spells.*** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

***Duration.*** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armour or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an ^^attack roll^^ against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a ^^saving throw^^.
- Take a :rsc-b: Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

### Level 1: Unarmoured Defence

While you aren't wearing any armour, you can determine your base Armour Class one of the following ways:

_**Dexterity Based**_  
10 + your :ability-dex: Dexterity and :ability-cons: Constitution modifiers

_**Strength Based**^CM^_  
10 + your :ability-str: Strength and :ability-cons: Constitution modifiers. 

You can use a Shield and still gain these benefit.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can do *one* of the following:

_**Change Weapon**_  
You can practice weapon drills and change *one* of those weapon choices

_**Replace Weapon Mastery**^CM^_   
You can choose *one* kind of Mastery weapons you're using and replace its Mastery property of with another Mastery property. The chosen kind of weapon must qualify for the new property. For example, you could replace the Longsword's Sap property with the Push property.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on :d20-save: Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you :d20-adv: **Advantage** on attack rolls using :ability-str: Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have :d20-adv: **Advantage** during that time.

### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your :rsc-speed: Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armour.

### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on Initiative rolls.

### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the :rsc-b: Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your :rsc-speed: Speed.

### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any :d20-adv: **Advantage** on one :ability-str: Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage**. 

If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

***Forceful Blow.*** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your :rsc-speed: Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

***Hamstring Blow.*** The target's :rsc-speed: Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a :d20-save: DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Level 13: Brutal Strike Improvement

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

***Staggering Blow.*** The target has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make :rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

***Sundering Blow.*** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armour.

### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a :d20-check: Strength check or :d20-save: Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](../../option/feat/feat-boon.md) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your :ability-str: Strength and :ability-con: Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
