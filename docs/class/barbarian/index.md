# The Barbarian

***For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.***

## Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power that is called your Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action, provided you aren't wearing Heavy Armor.
While active, your Rage has the following effects:

- **Damage Resistance.** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
- **Rage Damage**. When you make an attack with a weapon using Strength or an Unarmed Strikeand deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- **Strength Advantage.** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- **No Concentration or Spells.** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy Armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one or more of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table. 

You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

## Level 1: Unarmoured Defence

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

## Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian table.

## Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. 

You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws, unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

## Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

## Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice: 

- [Path of the Berserker](berserker.md)
- [Path of the Wild Heart](wild-heart.md)
- [Path of the World Tree](world-tree.md)
- [Path of the Zealot](zealot.md)

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Barbarian level and lower.

## Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the list of skills available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility and senses.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement](../../character-creation/feat/feat-4th-level.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

As shown on the Barbarian table, you gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.

## Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy Armor.

## Level 7: Feral Instict

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

## Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can Move up to half your Speed.

## Level 9: Brutal Strike 

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo Advantage on the next attack roll you make on your turn with a Strength-based attack. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

- **Forceful Blow.** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then Move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.
- **Hamstring Blow.** The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

## Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

## Level 13: Brutal Strike Improvement

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

- **Staggering Blow.** The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.
- **Sundering Blow.** Your blow leaves an opening in the creature's defense for an ally until the start of your next turn. The next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a bonus to that roll equal to your Rage Damage.

## Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest. 

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. The Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious, not the Incapacitated, condition or don Heavy Armor. 

## Level 17: Brutal Strike Improvement

The extra damage your Brutal Strike deals increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects when you use your Brutal Strike feature. 

## Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

## Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, and their maximum is now 26.
