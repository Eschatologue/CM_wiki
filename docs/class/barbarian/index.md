# Barbarian

> *The strong embrace the wild that hides inside - keen instincts, primal physicality, and most of all, an unbridled, unquenchable rage.*

Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is an incarnation of a predator's ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } if you aren't wearing Heavy armour.

You can enter your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

While active, your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } follows the rules below.

#### Damage Resistance 

You have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{ .dmg-phys }, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{ .dmg-phys }, and **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{ .dmg-phys } damage.

#### Rage Damage 

When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

#### Strength Advantage 

You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

#### No Concentration or Spells

You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.

#### Duration 

The **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armour or have the Incapacitated condition. If your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is still active on your next turn, you can extend the **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to extend your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }.

Each time the **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } for up to 10 minutes.

### Level 1: Unarmoured Defence

While you aren't wearing any armour, you can choose the following option to determine your base **Armour Class**:

**Dexterity Based**{ .inl } 10 plus your :abl-dex: Dexterity and :abl-cons: Constitution modifiers; or

**Strength Based**{ .inl } 10 plus your :abl-str: Strength and :abl-cons: Constitution modifiers.

You can use a Shield and still gain these benefit.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.

You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on :d20-save: Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.

### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on attack rolls using :abl-str: Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } during that time.

### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.

In addition, while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action on your turn.

### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armour.

### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } rolls.

### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } you take to enter your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }, you can move up to half your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em }.

### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on one :abl-str: Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 }. 

If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } , and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**Forceful Blow**{ .inl } The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

**Hamstring Blow**{ .inl } The target's **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 :d20-save: Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, the DC resets to 10.

### Level 13: Brutal Strike Improvement

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

**Staggering Blow**{ .inl } The target has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on the next saving throw it makes, and it can't make **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**{ .rsc } until the start of your next turn.

**Sundering Blow**{ .inl } Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 }, you can regain all expended uses of **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }. After you regain uses of **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

In addition, your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armour.

### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.
