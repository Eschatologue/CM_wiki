# Path of the Giant

> *Channel the Stature and Power of Giants*

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Giant draw strength from the same primal forces as giants. As they rage, these barbarians surge with elemental power and grow in size, taking on forms that evoke the glory of giants. Some barbarians look like oversized versions of themselves, perhaps with a hint of elemental energy flaring in their eyes and around their weapons. Others transform more dramatically, taking on the appearance of an actual giant or a form similar to an Elemental, wreathed in fire, frost, or lightning.

### Level 3: Giant's Power

The primal force of giants wreaths within you.

***Giant's Tongue.*** You can speak, read, and write Giant or one other language of your choice if you already know Giant.

***Giant Magic.*** You learn the *Elementalism* cantrip and one other cantrip of your choice: either [Druidcraft]* or *[Thaumaturgy]*. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Level 3: Giant's Havoc

Your rage pulls strength from the primal might of giants, transforming you into a hulking force of destruction. When your Rage is active, you gain the following benefits:

***Giant's Cleaver.*** You choose one weapon you are holding and infuse it with primordial power. It gains the Thrown (20/60) property and if it already has the Thrown property its normal and long range increase by 20 feet. If you throw the weapon, it instantly reappears in your hand after you hit or miss a target. The weapon's infusion is suppressed while a creature other than you wields it.

***Giant Stature.*** Your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you can choose to become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If there isn't enough room for you to increase your size, your size doesn't change.

### Level 6: Element of Power

Your physique is bolstered by the primordial elements.

***Elemental Fortitude.*** You have Resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-thunder: Thunder, or :dmg-lightning: Lightning. You can choose a different type when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

***Elemental Cleaver.*** When you use your Giant's Cleaver, the weapon is infused with one of the following damage types: :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-thunder: Thunder, or :dmg-lightning: Lightning Its damage type changes to the chosen type and it deals an extra 1d6 damage on a hit. You can use your Bonus Action to change the damage type.

### Level 10: Mighty Impel

Your connection to giant strength allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. 

As a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can choose one Medium or smaller creature within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength save (DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect. If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn't on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing with the Prone condition.

### Level 14: Demiurgic Colossus

The primordial power of your rage intensifies.

***Colossal Stature.*** While your Rage is active, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you can use your Mighty Impel to move creatures that are Large or smaller.

***Improved Elemental Cleaver.*** The extra damage dealt by your Elemental Cleaver feature increases to 2d6.
