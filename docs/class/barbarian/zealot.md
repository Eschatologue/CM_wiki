# Path of the Zealot

For Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot, their Rage is not merely a connection to nature; it is a gift from a god. These Barbarians often experience their Rage as an ecstatic experience of union with their gods, infusing them with divine power to pursue the gods' purposes in the world.

### Level 3: Divine Fury

You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is :dmg-necrotic: Necrotic or :dmg-radiant: Radiant; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.

### Level 3: Warrior of the Gods

A divine entity helps ensure you can continue to fight. You have a pool of four :die-d12: **d12**s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.

The pool's maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).

### Level 6: Fanatical Focus

If you fail a saving throw while your Rage is active, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this feature only once per active Rage.

### Level 10: Zealous Presence

As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. If you've run out of uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your Rage to activate Zealous Presence instead of Rage.

### Level 14: Rage Beyond Death

When you activate tyour Rage, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Fly Speed.*** You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.

***Resistance.*** You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic and Radiang damage

***Revification.*** When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Rage to instead change the target's hit point to a number equal to your Barbarian level.
