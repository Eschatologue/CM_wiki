# Path of the Zealot

> *Rage in Ecstatic Union with a God*

For Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot, their Rage is not merely a connection to nature; it is a gift from a god. These Barbarians often experience their Rage as an ecstatic experience of union with their gods, infusing them with divine power to pursue the gods' purposes in the world.

### Level 3: Divine Fury

You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{.rsc} takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } or **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi }; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.

### Level 3: Warrior of the Gods

A divine entity helps ensure you can continue to fight. You have a pool of four :die-d12: d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}, you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll's total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

The pool's maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).

### Level 6: Fanatical Focus

If you fail a saving throw while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this feature only once per active **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }.

### Level 10: Zealous Presence

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. If you've run out of uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } to activate Zealous Presence instead of **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }.

### Level 14: Rage Beyond Death

When you activate tyour **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

**Fly Speed**{.inl} You have a Fly Speed equal to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em } and can hover.

**Resistance**{.inl} You have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr }, **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } and **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } damage

**Revification**{.inl} When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 Hit Points, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{.rsc} to expend a use of your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } to instead change the target's hit point to a number equal to your Barbarian level.
