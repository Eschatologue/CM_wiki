# Rune Knight

> *Channel the Runic Magic of Giants*

Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.

### Level 3: Rune Carver

You can use magic runes to enhance your gear.

***Inscription Equipment.*** You gain a set of Smith's Tools and you have proficiency with it. You also learn to speak, read and write Giant. 

***Learning Runes.*** You learn two Runes of your choice, from among the Runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Rune you know with a different one from this feature. You learn an additional Rune when you reach certain levels in this class: level 7 (3 uses), level 10 (4 uses) and level 15 (5 uses).

***Inscribing Runes.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of Runes you know, and you inscribe a different Rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a Weapon, a suit of Armor, a Shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your Rune remains on an object until you finish a Long Rest, and an object can bear only one of your Runes at a time. A Rune can be invoked for an effect detailed in its description, once you do so, you can't invoke the same Rune again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

The following Runes are available to you when you learn a Rune. If a Rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the Rune. If a Rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Constitution modifier.

***Cloud Rune.*** This Rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants.

- While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this Rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Sleight of Hand checks and Deception checks.
- When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to invoke the Rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range.

***Fire Rune.*** This Rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths.

- While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this Rune, you have Expertise in the Artisan's Tools you have proficiency in.
- When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the Rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra 2d6 Fire damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition for 1 minute. While Restrained by the shackles, the target takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success.

***Frost Rune.*** This Rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants.

- While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this Rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Animal Handling checks and Intimidation checks.
- You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution, as well as to the saving throw DC of your Unarmed Strikes.

***Stone Rune.*** This Rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants.

- While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Insight checks, and you have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.
- When a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to invoke the Rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature has the Charmed condition for 1 minute. While Charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and has the Incapacitated condition, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Hill Rune (Level 7 or Higher).*** This Rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant.

- While wearing or carrying an object that bears this Rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saves against having the Poisoned condition, and you have Resistance against Poison damage.
- You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, gaining Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage for 1 minute.

***Storm Rune (Level 7 or Higher).*** Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer.

- While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this Rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Arcana checks, and you can't be Surprised as long as you don't have the Incapacitated condition.
- You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } or :d20-disadv: Disdvantage.

***Gigantic Force.*** Once per turn, when you make an attack you deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
