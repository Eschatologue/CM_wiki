# Psi Warrior

*Augment physical might with psionic power*

Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki train to become such warriors, as do some of the most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming Psi Warriors.

As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.

## Psionic Power â€“ Level 3

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which fuel various psionic powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior Enerdy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.
