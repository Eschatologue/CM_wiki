# Master of Arms

> *Unlocks the Potential in Every Weapon*

While others supplement their martial skills with manoeuvres, tactics, or even magic, the Master of Arms focuses on mastering weapons themselves. With deep knowledge of each weapon's design and function, they draw out hidden strengths from every armament. To them, every blade, bow, or hammer is a perfected toolâ€”never wielded without skill, never used without purpose.

### Level 3: Artisan's Touch

Your familiarity with weapons extends to their creation and maintenance.

You gain proficiency with two set of Artisan's tools of your choice from the following: Gunsmith's Tools^CM^, Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Woodcarver's tools.

### Level 3: Advanced Weapon Properties

Your deep understanding of weapon construction and usage grants you unique advantages when wielding them.

Choose **two** weapon properties from the list below. When you wield a weapon that has a chosen property, it gains the corresponding benefit. You choose one additional property at levels 7 (3 total), 15 (4 total), and 18 (5 total).

You can change your selected properties whenever you complete a **:rest-short: Long Rest**.

**Ammunition**
:   When you wield a weapon with the **:wp-prop-ammunition: Ammunition**{.wp} property, its Normal and Long ranges are doubled.

**Burst-Fire**
:   When you make a **:rsc-a: Burst Fire Attack**{.rsc}, you can change the area of effect to one of the following:

    - **30-foot :aoe-cone: Cone**, originating from you.
    - A **:aoe-line: Line** with a width of **5 ft.** and length equal to half the weapon's normal range.

**Heavy**
:   When you miss with an attack using a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-heavy: Heavy**{.wp} property, the target still takes damage equal to the ability modifier used for the attack (usually Strength). This includes any magical bonus to attack and damage rolls (e.g., +1, +2, +3). This damage is of the weapon's normal type.

**Finesse**
:   When you hit a creature with a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-finesse: Finesse**{.wp} property, that creature can't make **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**{.rsc} against you for the rest of your turn.

**Light**
:   When you take the **:rsc-a: Dash**{.rsc}, **:rsc-a: Dodge**{.rsc}, or **:rsc-a: Disengage**{.rsc} action, you can make one attack with a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-light: Light**{.wp} property as part of that action.

**Reach**
:   While wielding a weapon with the **:wp-prop-reach: Reach**{.wp} property, the area within the weapon's reach around you is considered Difficult Terrain for creatures you choose.

**Loading**
:   You ignore the **:wp-prop-loading: Loading**{.wp} property of weapons you wield.

**Thrown**
:   The Normal and Long ranges of weapons with the **:wp-prop-thrown: Thrown**{.wp} property are doubled. Moreover, a Ranged attack with these weapon ignores Half Cover and Three-Quarters Cover.

**Two-Handed**
:   While wielding a weapon with the **:wp-prop-two-handed: Two-Handed**{.wp} property, you can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} to increase its reach by 5 feet until the end of your turn.

**Versatile**
:   When you are hit by an attack you can see while wielding a weapon with the **:wp-prop-versatile: Versatile**{.wp} property, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{.rsc} to reduce the incoming damage by an amount equal to the weapon's damage die (e.g., 1d8 or 1d10 if used two-handed).

**No Weapon Properties**
:   While wielding a weapon that has no properties (e.g., Mace, Morningstar), the number you need to roll to score a Critical Hit is reduced by 1. This effect stacks with other sources of critical hit range reduction.

### Level 7: Signature Weapon

You have honed your skill with certain weapons to perfection. When you deal damage with a weapon that has a property you selected via Advanced Weapon Properties, you gain the following benefits:

**Change Damage Type**{.inl} The weapon can deal your choice of **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps}, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps}, or **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{.dmg-bps} damage.

**Improved Damage Die**{.inl} Its damage die increases as shown in the Signature Weapon Die table.

#### Signature Weapon Die

<div class="grid" markdown>

| Normal Weapon Die | Signature Weapon Die |
|:-:|:-:|
| `1` | `1d4` |
| `1d4` | `1d6` |
| `1d6` | `1d8` |

| Normal Weapon Die | Signature Weapon Die |
|:-:|:-:|
| `1d8` | `1d10` |
| `1d10` | `2d6` |
| `1d12` / `2d6` | `1d12+1` or `2d6+1` |

</div>

### Level 10: Lore of Armaments

Your knowledge of martial craftsmanship deepens, granting you the following benefits:

**Ritual Casting**{.inl} You can cast the [:spell-lv1: Identify](../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#identify) spell as a Ritual. You don't need to provide the material component when identifying a weapon or armour.

**Weapon Savant**{.inl} You ignore all class, species, and level restrictions when attuning to or using a weapon or armour.

### Level 15: Adaptive Discipline

Unlike other Fighters, whose weapons complement their style, you let the weapon shape your technique.

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can replace one Fighting Style feat you have with another you don't currently have.

### Level 18: Perfect Execution

Your mastery over weaponry enables strikes of unnatural precision.

When you make an attack roll with a weapon that has a property you selected in Advanced Weapon Properties, you can choose to use your Fighter level in place of the d20. If this number would result in a critical hit, the attack is treated as a critical hit.

You can use this feature **twice**, and regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
