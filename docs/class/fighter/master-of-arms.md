# Master of Arms

> *Unlocks the Potential in Every Weapon*

While others rely on tactics or magic, the Master of Arms masters weapons themselves. With deep knowledge of each weapon's design and function, they draw out hidden strengths from every armament. To them, every blade, bow, or hammer is a perfected toolâ€”never wielded without skill, never used without purpose.

### Level 3: Signature Weapon

Rather than many, you pursue the mastery of few weapon. 

Select two weapon with which you are proficient (such as a Longsword, Greatsword, or Battleaxe). This becomes your **Signature Weapon**. When you deal damage with your Signature Weapon, its damage die changes according to the **Signature Weapon Die** table.

At level 7, and again at level 10 and 15, you may select an additional Signature Weapon. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you may replace one of your Signature Weapons with another weapon you are proficient with.

##### Signature Weapon Die

<div class="grid" markdown>

| Normal Weapon Die | Signature Weapon Die |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 1d4 | 1d6 |
| 1d6 | 1d8 |

| Normal Weapon Die | Signature Weapon Die |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1d8 | 1d10 |
| 1d10 | 1d12 / 2d6 |
| 1d12 / 2d6 | 1d12+1 or 2d6+1 |

You can choose which option to use when two results are listed (such as 1d12 or 2d6). The damage die upgrade only applies to your chosen Signature Weapon, and does not affect magical or class-based bonus damage.
