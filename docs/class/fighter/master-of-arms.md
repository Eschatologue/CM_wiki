# Master of Arms

> *Unlocks the Potential in Every Weapon*

While others suplement their martial skills with manoeuvre, tactics or even magic, the Master of Arms masters weapons themselves. With deep knowledge of each weapon's design and function, they draw out hidden strengths from every armament. To them, every blade, bow, or hammer is a perfected toolâ€”never wielded without skill, never used without purpose.

### Level 3: Advanced Weapon Properties

Your deep understanding of weapon construction and usage grants you unique advantages when wielding them.

Choose **two** weapon properties from the list below. When you wield a weapon that has a chosen property, it gains the corresponding benefit. You can choose one additional weapon property when you reach level 7 (3 total), 15 (4 total), and 18 (5 total).  

You can change your selected properties whenever you complete a **:rest-short: Short Rest**.

**Ammunition**
:   When you wield a weapon with the **:wp-prop-ammunition: Ammunition**{.wp} property, the Normal and Long ranges of the weapon are doubled.

**Burst-Fire**
:   When you make a **:rsc-a: Burst Fire Attack**{.rsc}, you can change the area of effect to be one of the following:

    - **30-foot :aoe-cone: Cone**, orginating from you.
    - **15-foot :aoe-cube: Cube**, within the weapon's normal range.
    - A **:aoe-line: Line** with a width of **5 ft.** and the length equals half the weapon's normal range.

**Heavy**
:   When you miss with an attack using a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-heavy: Heavy**{.wp} property, the target still takes damage equal to the ability modifier used for the attack (usually Strength). This damage includes any enchantment to the weapon's attack and damage rolls (such as +1, +2, or +3). This damage is of the weapon's normal type.

**Finesse**
:   When you hit a creature with a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-finesse: Finesse**{.wp} property, that creature can't make **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**{.rsc} against you for the rest of your turn.

**Light**
:   When you take the **:rsc-a: Dash**{.rsc}, **:rsc-a: Dodge**{.rsc}, or **:rsc-a: Disengage**{.rsc} action on your turn, you can make one attack with a weapon that has the **:wp-prop-light: Light**{.wp} property as part of that action.

**Reach**
:   While you are wielding a weapon with the **:wp-prop-reach: Reach**{.wp} property, the area within that weapon's reach around you is considered Difficult Terrain for creatures that you choose.

**Loading**
:   You ignore the **:wp-prop-loading: Loading**{.wp} property of weapons you wield.

**Thrown**
:   The normal and long ranges of a weapon with the **:wp-prop-thrown: Thrown**{.wp} property are doubled.

**Two-Handed**
:   While wielding a weapon with the **:wp-prop-two-handed: Two-Handed**{.wp} property, you can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} to extend your Reach with that weapon by 5 feet until the end of your turn.

**Versatile**
:   When you are hit by an attack that you can see while wielding weapon with the **:wp-prop-versatile: Versatile**{.wp} property, you can use your Reaction to reduce the incoming damage by an amount equal to the weapon's damage die (e.g, 1d8 for a Longsword, or 1d10 when wielded with two hands).

**No Weapon Properties**
:   When you are wielding a weapon that has no properties (e.g, Mace, Morningstars), the number you need to roll to score Critical Hits with those weapons are reduced by 1. This effect can stack.

### Level 7: Signature Weapon

You have honed your skill with a select few weapons. When you deal damage with a weapon that has a property you selected in the Advanced Weapon Properties feature, you gain the following benefits:

**Change Damage Type**{.inl} The weapon can deal your choice of **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{.dmg-bps}, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{.dmg-bps}, or **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{.dmg-bps} damage.

**Improved Damage Die**{.inl} The weapon damage die changes according to the Signature Weapon Die table.
