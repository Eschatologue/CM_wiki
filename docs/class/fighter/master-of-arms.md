# Master of Arms

> *Unlocks the Potential in Every Weapon*

While others suplement their martial skills with, manoeuvre, tactics or even magic, the Master of Arms masters weapons themselves. With deep knowledge of each weapon's design and function, they draw out hidden strengths from every armament. To them, every blade, bow, or hammer is a perfected tool—never wielded without skill, never used without purpose.

### Level 3: Advanced Weapon Properties

Your deep understanding of weapon construction and usage grants you unique advantages when wielding them.

Choose two weapon properties from the list below. When you wield a weapon that has a chosen property, it gains the corresponding benefit.

You can change your selected properties whenever you complete a Short Rest.

**Ammunition**{.inl} When you wield a weapon with the Ammunition property, you can target creatures behind full cover–provided you have seen them within the last minute and there is a clear, unobstructed path between you and the target (such as a narrow slit, gap, or firing angle). Additionally, creatures do not gain the benefits of half or three-quarters cover against your attacks with these weapons.

**Burst-Fire**{.inl} When you make a **:rsc-a: Burst Fire Attack**{.rsc}, you can change the area of effect to be one of the following:
- 30-foot :aoe-cone: Cone, orginating from you.
- 15-foot :aoe-cube: Cube, within the weapon's normal range.
- A :aoe-line: Line with a width of 5 ft and the length equals half the weapon's normal range.

**Heavy**{.inl} When you miss with an attack using a weapon that has the Heavy property, the target still takes damage equal to the ability modifier used for the attack (usually Strength). This damage includes any magical bonus to the weapon's attack and damage rolls (such as +1, +2, or +3). This damage is of the weapon's normal type.

**Finesse**{.inl} When you hit a creature with a weapon that has the Finesse property, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

**Light**{.inl} When you take the Dash, Dodge, or Disengage action on your turn, you can make one attack with a weapon that has the Light property as part of that action.

**Reach**{.inl} While you are wielding a weapon with the Reach property, the area within that weapon's reach around you is considered difficult terrain for creatures that you choose.

**Loading**{.inl} You ignore the Loading property of weapons you wield.

**Thrown**{.inl} When making a ranged attack with a weapon that has the Thrown property, the number you need to roll for a critical hit is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.

**Two-Handed**{.inl} While wielding a weapon with the Two-Handed property, you can take a bonus action to extend your reach with that weapon by 5 feet until the end of your turn. The weapon also gain the **:wp-mas: Brace**{.wp} mastery property, in which you can use.

**Versatile**{.inl} When you are hit by an attack that you can see, you can use your reaction to reduce the incoming damage by an amount equal to the weapon's damage die as listed in the Versatile property (e.g., 1d10 for a longsword when used with two hands).

**Range**{.inl} The normal and long ranges of a weapon with the Range property are increased by half. For example, a weapon with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet would have its normal range increased to 45 feet and its long range increased to 135 feet.

### Level 7: Signature Weapon

You have honed your skill with a select few weapons. When you deal damage with a weapon that has a property you selected in the Advanced Weapon Properties feature, its damage die changes according to the Signature Weapon Die table.
