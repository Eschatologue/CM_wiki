# Fighter Archetype: Brawler

***Brawlers focus their training and study not on swordplay and battle tactics, but on the skills needed to turn a punch or kick into a brutal strike and any innocuous object into a deadly weapon. Some Brawlers thrive in tavern scuffles and street rumbles, while others excel in espionage, wielding ordinary objects with the deadliness of an assassin's knife.***

## Level 3: Unarmed Expert

You can roll 1d6 plus your Strength modifier in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike. If you aren't holding any weapons or a Shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

## Level 3: Improvised Expert

You are proficient with Improvised Weapons. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one weapon property from the One-Handed list and one from the Two-Handed list:

- **One-Handed:** Light or Thrown (Range 20/60)
- **Two-Handed:** Reach or Thrown (Range 10/30)

Until the end of your next Long Rest, the One- Handed choice applies to the one-handed Improvised Weapons you wield, and the Two- Handed choice applies to the two-handed ones.
In addition, whenever you attack with an Improvised Weapon, you can give it one of the following Mastery properties for that attack, depending on whether it can be wielded in one hand or two:

- **One-Handed:** Sap, Slow, or Vex
- **Two-Handed:** Cleave, Push, or Topple

## Level 18: Unarmed Specialist
