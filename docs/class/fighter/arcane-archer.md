# Arcane Archer

> *Master Magical Archery Techniques - Written by PerfectlyCircularSeal*

An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of their most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.

### Level 3: Arcane Archer Lore

You learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature – typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You have proficiency in the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you learn the Prestidigitation or Druidcraft cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it.

### Level 3: Arcane Shot

You learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. You learn two Arcane Shots of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below). You learn an extra Arcane Shot of your choice when you reach level 7, and again at level 10, at level 15, and level 18. The damage of all Arcane Shots increases at level 10 and level 18.

When you use the Attack action and you hit a creature with a ranged weapon, you can activate one of your Arcane Shots. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Level 7: Magic Shot

You gain the ability to infuse your projectiles with magic. 

***Infused Shots.*** Whenever you attack with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal the weapon’s damage type or Force damage.
***Curved Shots.*** When you attack with a ranged weapon and miss, you can use your Reaction to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.

### Level 15: Ever-Ready Shot

If you roll Initiative and are missing any uses of your Arcane Shot, you regain one use of it.

### Arcane Shot Options

If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier.

***Banishing Shot.*** You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The target must succeed on a Charisma save or be banished. While banished in this way, its Speed is 0, and it has the Incapacitated condition. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. At level 10, the target also takes an extra 2d6 Force damage when the arrow hits it. This damage increases to 3d6 at level 18.

***Beguiling Shot.*** Your enchantment magic causes this projectile to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 Psychic damage and makes a Wisdom save. On a failed save, it has the Charmed condition until the start of your next turn, with the chosen ally as the source. The Psychic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Bursting Shot.*** You imbue the projectile with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. It detonates after it hits or misses the target. The target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 3d6 Force damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The Force damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Enfeebling Shot.*** You weave necromantic magic into your projectile. The target takes an extra 2d6 Necrotic damage and makes a Constitution save. On a failed save, all damage dealt by the target is halved. The Necrotic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Grasping Shot.*** When this projectile strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 Poison damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet. The first time it moves on its turn without teleporting, it takes 2d6 Slashing damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength save. On a success, the effect ends. The brambles last for 1 minute, until you use it again, or if the target manages to escape early. The Poison damage and Slashing damage both increase by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).

***Piercing Shot.*** You use transmutation magic to give your projectile an ethereal quality. The target takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage. After the projectile hits or misses the target it continues flying in a 30-foot Line, passing through objects and ignoring cover. Each creature in that Line must make a Dexterity save. A creature takes 3d6 Piercing damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one. The Piercing damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Seeking Shot.*** Using divination magic, you grant your projectile the ability to seek out your target, allowing it to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location. The Force damage increases by 2d6 at level 10 (5d6) and at level 18 (7d6).

***Shadow Shot.*** You weave illusion magic into your projectile, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The target takes an extra 2d6 Psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom save or have the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. The Psychic damage increases by 1d6 at level 10 (3d6) and at level 18 (4d6).
