Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenariesâ€”as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armour. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.

Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every Fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, and use a bow. Fighters master various weapon techniques, allowing them to get the best use from a wide variety of weapons, and a well equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with shields and every form of armour. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants everywhere.

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a Fighter. There are great risks but also great rewards: gold, magic weaponry, and glory.

### Level 1: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (those feats have this feature as a prerequisite).

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

### Level 1: Second Wind

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can do one of the following:

***Change Weapon***  
You can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices, or

_**Replace Weapon Mastery**^CM^_   
You can choose any of the kinds of Mastery weapons you're using and replace the Mastery property of each with another Mastery property. The chosen kind of weapon must qualify for the new property. For example, you could replace the Longsword's Sap property with the Push property.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.

### Level 2: Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Level 2: Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.

### Level 3: Fighter Subclass

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 5: Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

### Level 9: Indomitable

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.

### Level 9: Tactical Master

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.

### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 13: Studied Attacks

You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [Epic Boon feat](../../option/feat/feat-boon.md) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Combat Prowess is recommended.

### Level 20: Three Extra Attacks

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
