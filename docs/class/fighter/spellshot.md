# Spellshot

> *Masters of Arcane Precision*

Once known as Sylvian Archers, Spellshots are elite combatants who weave magic into their archery with deadly finesse. What began as a secretive elven tradition has since spread across cultures, studied and adapted by those who blend arcane talent with deadly accuracy.

## Arcane Shots Options

If an option requires a saving throw, your **Arcane Shot save DC** equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence Modifier.

**Banishing Shot**
:   On hit, target must succeed on a **:d20-save: CHA Save**{.d20} or be banished. While banished in this way, its **:rsc-spd: Speed** is **0**, and it has the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

    *You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location.*{.quote}

**Beguiling Shot**
:   On hit, choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target takes an extra **2d6 :dmg-psyc: Psychic**{.dmg-psyc} damage and makes a **:d20-save: WIS Save**{.d20}. On a failed save, it has the **Charmed**{.cond} condition until the start of your next turn, with the chosen ally as the source.

    *Your enchantment magic causes this projectile to temporarily beguile its target.*{.quote}

**Bursting Shot**
:   It detonates after it hits or misses the target. The target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it make a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20}. A creature takes 3d6 Force damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one.

    *You imbue the projectile with force energy drawn from the school of evocation.*{.cond}

**Enfeebling Shot**
:   The target takes an extra 2d6 Necrotic damage and makes a **:d20-save: CON Save**{.d20}. On a failed save, all damage dealt by the target is halved.

    *You weave necromantic magic into your projectile.*{.cond}

**Grasping Shot**
:   When this projectile strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The target takes an extra 2d6 Poison damage and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet. The first time it moves on its turn without teleporting, it takes 2d6 Slashing damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a **:d20-save: STR Save**{.d20}. On a success, the effect ends. The brambles last for 1 minute, until you use it again, or if the target manages to escape early.

**Piercing Shot**
:   The target takes an extra 3d6 Piercing damage. After the projectile hits or misses the target it continues flying in a 30-foot Line, passing through objects and ignoring cover. Each creature in that Line must make a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20}. A creature takes 3d6 Piercing damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful one.

    *You use transmutation magic to give your projectile an ethereal quality.*{.quote}

**Seeking Shot**
:   When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target makes a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{.d20}. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 Force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.

    *Using divination magic, you grant your projectile the ability to seek out your target, allowing it to curve and twist its path in search of its prey.*{.cond}

**Shadow Shot**
:   The target takes an extra 2d6 Psychic damage, and it must succeed on a **:d20-save: WIS Save**{.d20} or have the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn.

    *You weave illusion magic into your projectile, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows*{.quote}
