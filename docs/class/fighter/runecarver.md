# Runecarver

> *Wield the Primordial Might of the Jötnar*

Runecarvers channel the ancient magic of the jötnar, the primordial titans who shaped the world before mortals walked it. Their runes are more than mere symbols—they are the echoes of creation itself, remnants of a time when giants and gods clashed for dominion over the realms.

You may have uncovered these sigils in the ruins of a forgotten age, inherited them from a wandering jötunn, or had them seared into your soul through an ancient pact. However you came by this knowledge, you now carve these runes into your weapons, armor, and flesh, wielding the primal forces of the world as the giants once did.

### Level 3: Runecarving

You can use magic runes to enhance your gear.

#### Inscription Equipment

You gain a set of Smith's Tools and you have proficiency with it. You also learn to speak, read and write Giant. 

#### Learning Runes

You learn two Runes of your choice, from among the Runes described below, and each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Rune you know with a different one from this feature. 

You learn an additional Rune when you reach certain levels in this class: level 7 (3 runes), level 10 (4 runes), level 15 (5 runes), and level 18 (6 runes).

#### Inscribing Runes

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can touch a number of objects equal to the number of Runes you know, and you inscribe a different Rune onto each of the objects. To be eligible, an object must be a Weapon, a suit of Armour, a Shield, a piece of jewelry, or something else you can wear or hold in a hand. Your Rune remains on an object until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, and an object can bear only one of your Runes at a time.

#### Rune Charge

You have a number of Rune Charge(s) up to your Constitution modifier. Rune Charge(s) is expended whenever you use it to **Invoke** a rune's effect or other class feature. You regain one expended use when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. 

#### Rune Save DC

If a Rune requires a saving throw, your Rune Magic save DC equals `8 + PB + CON modifier`.

#### Rune List

The following Runes are available to you when you learn a Rune. If a Rune has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to learn the Rune.

A Rune can only take effect or *Invoked* if the object its inscribed on is either **worn** or **carried** by the creature.

**Cloud Rune**
:   This Rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Sleight of Hand checks and Deception checks.

    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to invoke the Rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range.

**Fire Rune**
:   This Rune's magic channels the masterful craftsmanship of great smiths. You have Expertise in the Artisan's Tools you have proficiency in.

    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, you can invoke the Rune to summon fiery shackles: the target takes an extra **(Fighter level) :dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } damage, and it must succeed on a **:d20-save: STR Save**{ .d20 } or have the **Restrained**{ .cond } condition for 1 minute. While **Restrained**{ .cond } by the shackles, the target takes **(Fighter level) :dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, banishing the shackles on a success.

**Frost Rune**
:   This Rune's magic evokes the might of those who survive in the wintry wilderness, such as frost giants. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Animal Handling checks and Intimidation checks.
    
    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to increase your sturdiness. For 10 minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws that use Strength or Constitution, as well as to the saving throw DC of your **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }.

**Stone Rune**
:   This Rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Insight checks, and you have Darkvision with a range of 120 feet.
    
    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   When a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to invoke the Rune and force the creature to make a **:d20-save: WIS Save**{ .d20 }. Unless the save succeeds, the creature has the **Charmed**{ .cond } condition for 1 minute. While Charmed in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and has the **Incapacitated**{ .cond } condition, descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Hill Rune** <br>_Level 7+_
:    This Rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object that bears this Rune, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saves against having the **Poisoned**{ .cond } condition, and you have **:dmg-res: Resistance** against **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn } damage.

    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, gaining **:dmg-res: Resistance** to **:dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning**{ .dmg-bps }, **:dmg-prcg: Piercing**{ .dmg-bps }, and **:dmg-slsh: Slashing**{ .dmg-bps } damage for 1 minute.

**Storm Rune** <br>_Level 7+_
:   Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant seer. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Arcana checks, and you can't be Surprised as long as you don't have the Incapacitated condition.

    **Invoke**<br>_1 Rune Charge(s)_
    :   You can invoke the Rune as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you have the **Incapacitated**{ .cond } condition. Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes a D20 Test, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to cause the roll to have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } or **:d20-dis: Disdvantage**{ .d20 }.

### Level 3: Jötunn’s Might

You have learned how to imbue yourself with the might of giants. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you magically gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

**Titan’s Form**{.inl} If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.

**Jötunn’s Strength**{.inl} You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**Runebound Strikes**{.inl} Once per turn, when you make an attack you deal an extra 1d6 damage to a target on a hit. The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach level 10 (2d6) and 17 (3d6).

You can use this once per **:rest-long: Long Rest**. When you have no uses of this feature left, you can expend one us of your Second Wind to use Giant's Might again.

### Level 7: Runeshield

By invoking the protective sigils of the jötnar, you can shield your allies from harm. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to expend **1 Rune Charge(s)** to add your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1) to the creature's AC against that attack.

### Level 10: Unyielding Fortitude

The runes etched into your body fortify your flesh and spirit. You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saves to resist Forced Movement and conditions such as **Poisoned**{ .cond }, **Stunned**{ .cond }, and **Prone**{ .cond }.

### Level 15: Elder Insight

The ancient knowledge of the jötnar flows through you, guiding you in battle. When you roll for Initiative while you have no Rune Charge(s) remaining, you regain 1 charge.

### Level 18: Runic Colossus

You have mastered the might of the jötnar, allowing your body to channel their full power. When you use [Jötunn’s Might](#level-3-jötunns-might), your can increase your size to Huge. When you do, your reach increases by 5 feet for the duration.
