# Samurai

> *Fight Deliberately and Precisely. Be Unwavering*

Every army needs warriors whose specialty is victory. The Samurai is a warrior who channels an indomitable fighting spirit to overcome any foe. Their resolve is unshakable, their discipline unmatched, and their skill honed to perfection. Those who stand in a Samurai's path face a simple choice: yield or die fighting.

### Level 3: Brush and Blade

You gain a set of Calligrapher's Tools and you have proficiency in it and two of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Level 3: Fighting Spirit

Your intensive training in battle grants you unparalleled focus.

***Precision.*** When you make an attack, you can grant yourself **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on all your attacks until the start of your next turn. You also gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Fighter level (minimum 1). 
   
***Counter.*** When a creature you can see hit or misses you with a Melee attack, you can take a :rsc-r: Reaction to make a melee weapon attack or an Unarmed Strike against the creature.

You can use your Fighting Spirit feature a total of 4 times, expending one use each time you use either *Precision* or *Counter*. You regain 1 expended use at the end of a Short Rest, and all expended uses at the end of a Long Rest. 

### Level 7: Elegant Courtier

Your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations.

***Well Mannered.*** Whenever you make a Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the result.

***Self Control.*** You have proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead have proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Level 10: Tactical Strike

When you use your [Tactical Shift](index.md#level-5-tactical-shift), you can make one melee attack as part of the :rsc-b: Bonus Action.

### Level 15: Unbroken Edge

Your training has reached extraordinary heights, allowing you to combine speed and precision with devastating results. You gain the following benefits: 

***Rapid Strikes.*** You trade accuracy for swift strikes. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on it, you can forgo the **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } for that roll to immediately make an additional attack as part of the same :rsc-a: Action, :rsc-b: Bonus Action or :rsc-r: Reaction.

***Helm Splitter.*** You trade accuracy for a powerful blow. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on it, you can forgo the **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } for that roll. On hit, the attack deals maximum damage.

### Level 18: Strength Before Death

*Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death.*

If you're reduced to **0 Hit Points**, you can use your :rsc-r: Reaction to avoid falling ^^Unconscious^^ and take an extra turn immediately. During this extra turn, while you still have 0 Hit Points, taking damage causes Death Save failures as usual (Three Death Save failures will still kill you). At the end of the extra turn, if you're still at 0 Hit Points, you fall ^^Unconscious^^.  

You can use this feature **once per Long Rest**.
