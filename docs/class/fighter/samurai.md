# Samurai

> *Fight Deliberately and Precisely. Be Unwavering*

The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A samurai's resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a samurai's path have two choices: yield or die fighting.

### Level 3: Brush and Blade

You gain a set of Calligrapher's Tools and you have proficiency in it and two of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Level 3: Fighting Spirit

Your intensive training in battle grants you unparalleled focus.

***Precision.*** Before you attack, you can enter a focused state, giving you :d20-adv: Advantage on all your attacks until the start of your next turn. You also gain **Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Fighter level (minimum 1). You can do this **4 times**, regaining 1 use after a Short Rest and all uses after a Long Rest.  
   
***Stamina.*** As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can restore **half** of your Second Wind uses (round up). You can only use this feature **once per Long Rest**.

### Level 7: Elegant Courtier

Your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations.

***Well Mannered.*** Whenever you make a Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the result.

***Self Control.*** You have proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead have proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Level 10: Tactical Strike

When you use your [Tactical Shift](index.md#level-5-tactical-shift), you can make one melee attack as part of the :rsc-b: Bonus Action.

### Level 15: Rapid Strike

*You learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes.*

Once per turn, if you make an attack and have :d20-adv: Advantage on it, you can forgo the :d20-adv: Advantage for that roll to make an additional attack against that target as part of the same :rsc-a: Action, :rsc-b: Bonus Action or :rsc-r: Reaction.

### Level 18: Strength Before Death

*Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death.*

If you're reduced to **0 Hit Points**, you can use your :rsc-r: Reaction to avoid falling ^^Unconscious^^ and take an extra turn immediately.  

During this extra turn, you still have 0 Hit Points, so taking damage causes Death Save failures as usual (Three Death Save failures will still kill you).  

At the end of the extra turn, if you're still at 0 Hit Points, you fall ^^Unconscious^^.  

You can use this feature **once per Long Rest**.
