# Samurai

*Fight Deliberately and Precisely. Be Unwavering*

The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A samurai’s resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a samurai’s path have two choices: yield or die fighting.

### Level 3: Brush and Blade

You gain a set of Calligrapher’s Tools and you have proficiency in it and two of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Level 3: Fighting Spirit

Your intensive training in battle grants you unparalleled focus.

&emsp; ***Precision.*** Before you make an attack, you can choose to enter a focus state giving yourself Advantage on attacks until the start of your next turn. When you do so, you also gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wisdom modifier + half of your Fighter level (minimum of 1). You can use this feature 4 times. You regain 1 expended use when you finish a Short Rest and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

&emsp; ***Stamina.*** As a Bonus Action, you can regain half of your [Second Wind](index.md#level-1-second-wind) uses (rounded up). Once you do so, you can’t do it again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 7: Elegant Courtier

Your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations.

&emsp; ***Well Mannered.*** Whenever you make a Persuasion check, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the result.

&emsp; ***Self Control.*** You have proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead have proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Level 10: Tactical Strike

When you use your [Tactical Shift](index.md#level-5-tactical-shift), you can make one melee attack as part of the Bonus Action.

### Level 15: Rapid Strike

You learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have Advantage on it, you can forgo the Advantage for that roll to make an additional attack against that target as part of the same action, Bonus Action or Reaction.

### Level 18: Strength Before Death

Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death. If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can use your Reaction to delay having the Unconscious condition, and you can immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 Hit Points during that extra turn, taking damage causes Death Save failures as normal, and three Death Save failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you have the Unconscious condition if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
