# Samurai

> *Fight Deliberately and Precisely. Be Unwavering*

Every army needs warriors whose specialty is victory. The Samurai is a warrior who channels an indomitable fighting spirit to overcome any foe. Their resolve is unshakable, their discipline unmatched, and their skill honed to perfection. Those who stand in a Samurai's path face a simple choice: yield or die fighting.

### Level 3: Brush and Blade

You gain a set of Calligrapher's Tools and you have proficiency in it and two of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, Performance, or Persuasion.

### Level 3: Fighting Spirit

Your intensive training in battle grants you unparalleled focus.

**Precision**{ .inl } When you make an attack, you can grant yourself **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on all your attacks until the start of your next turn. You also gain **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Fighter level (minimum 1). 
   
**Counter**{ .inl } When a creature you can see hit or misses you with an attack, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make a weapon attack or an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } against the triggering creature.

You can use your Fighting Spirit a number of times equals to your 1 + Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), expending one use each time you use either *Precision* or *Counter*. You regain 1 expended use at the end of a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and all expended uses at the end of a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. 

### Level 7: Elegant Courtier

Your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations.

**Well Mannered**{ .inl } When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, it gains bonus equals to your Wisdom modifier.

**Self Control**{ .inl } You have proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead have proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Level 10: Tactical Strike

When you use your [Tactical Shift](index.md#level-5-tactical-shift), you can make one weapon attack or an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } as part of the **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }.

### Level 15: Unbroken Edge

Your training has reached extraordinary heights, allowing you to combine speed and precision with devastating results. You gain the following benefits: 

**Rapid Strikes**{ .inl } You trade accuracy for swift strikes. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on it, you can forgo the **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } for that roll to immediately make one additional attack.

**Helm Splitter**{ .inl } You trade accuracy for a powerful blow. Once per turn, if you make an attack and have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on it, you can forgo the **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } for that roll. On hit, the attack deals maximum damage.

### Level 18: Strength Before Death

*Your fighting spirit can delay the grasp of death.*

If you're reduced to **0 Hit Points**, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to avoid falling ^^Unconscious^^ and take an extra turn immediately. During this extra turn, while you still have 0 Hit Points, taking damage causes Death Save failures as usual (Three Death Save failures will still kill you). At the end of the extra turn, if you're still at 0 Hit Points, you fall ^^Unconscious^^.  

You can use this feature **once per Long Rest**.
