# Fighter Archetype: Battle Master

*As a paragon of tactical superiority, you employ a wide array of combat manoeuvres to dominate every fight.*

Battle Masters are students of the art of battle, learning martial techniques passed down through generations. The most accomplished Battle Masters are well-rounded figures who combine their carefully honed combat skills with academic study in the fields of history, theory, and the arts.

## Level 3: Combat Superiority
Your experience on the battlefield has honed your fighting techniques. You learn Manoeuvre that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice.

**Superiority Dice**
