# Witchblade

> *Enhance Martial Prowess with Eldritch Macic*

Those who walk the dark path of the Witchblade are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These benefactors offer power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.

### Level 3: Pact Magic

You have learned to cast spells. See the chapter 7 for rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Witchblade.

#### Cantrips 

You know one cantrip of your choice from the [Warlock spell list]. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of this feature's cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Warlock spell list.

When you reach level 10 in this class, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

#### Spell Slots

The Witchblade Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1-4. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare a list of spells of level 1 and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spell from the [Warlock spell list].

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witchblade Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 7, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1-2.

#### Changing your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Warlock spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:ability-cha: **Charisma** is your spellcasting ability for your Witchblade spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this subclass.

### Level 3: Sanguine Offering

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack or an Unarmed Strike (Damage), you can expend one of your Fighter Hit Dice as part of the attack to deal an additional 1d10 :dmg-necrotic: Necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the normal damage of your weapon.

### Level 7: Otherworldly Step

You can use Eldritch power to slip through cracks in reality. When you use Second Wind, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you appear within 5 feet of a creature, you can make one weapon attack or an Unarmed Strike against it.

### Level 10: Enchanted Strikes

The Eldritch magic within your blood seeps into your weapon strikes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on the first Saving Throw you force it to make against a Witchblade spell before the end of your next turn.

### Level 15: Greater Offering

You can restore your own vitality by inflicting pain on others. When you use [Sanguine Offering](#level-3-sanguine-offering), you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to the :dmg-necrotic: Necrotic damage dealt to the creature.

Temporary Hit Points you gain from this feature last for 1 minute, or until you gain temporary hit points again.

### Level 18: Legendary Witchblade

You siphon power from death. When a creature dies within 30 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot, or 1d4 of your expended Hit Dice.

Once you use this feature you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use it again.
