# Fey Wanderer Conclave

> *Wield Fey Mirth and Fury*

A fey mystique surrounds you, thanks to the boon of an archfey, the shining fruit you ate from a talking tree, the magic spring you swam in, or some other auspicious event. However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.

### Level 3: Dreadful Strikes

You can augment your weapon strikes with mind-scarring magic, drawn from the gloomy hollows of the Feywild. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d4 Psychic damage to the target, which can take this extra damage only once per turn.

The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach Ranger level 11.

The magic of the Feywild guards your mind. You have advantage on saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
