# Broodweaver Conclave

> *Summon Arcane Constructs to Weave Control*

Broodweavers are masters of harnessing arcane strands that tie reality together, bending these threads to summon ethereal constructs known as *Threadlings*. These rangers use their unique connection to control and manipulate the battlefield, releasing waves of their constructs to harass foes or restrain enemies within intricate webs of arcane energy.

### Level 3: Mindspun Invocation

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Mindspun Invocation Spells Table, you thereaftrer always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Mindspun Invocation Spells

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:---:|:---|
| 3 | *Faerie Fire*, *Zephyr Strike* |
| 5 | *Misty Step*, *Web* |
| 9 | *Haste*, *Mass Healing Word* |
| 13 | *Divination*, *Greater Invisibility* |
| 17 | *Hold Monster*, *Telekinesis* |

### Level 3: Weaver's Call

You command intangible constructs made of pure energy to assist you in battle. These entities, known as *Threadlings*, act as a resource for the various features in this subclass. 

***Threadling Die.*** Your *Threadlings* are represented by a die, known as the *Threadling Die*, and a pool of dice that increases with your Ranger level. The Threadling Die table below shows the size and number of dice you have available.

##### Threadling Die Table

| Ranger Level | Die Size | Number of Dice |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 3 | :die-d6: **D6** | 3 |
| 5 | :die-d8: **D8** | 3 |
| 9 | :die-d10: **D10** | 4 |
| 13 | :die-d10: **D10** | 5 |
| 17 | :die-d12: **D12** | 6 |

Each feature that uses *Threadlings* expends these dice as specified in the feature's description. You cannot use a feature requiring *Threadling Dice* if all your dice are expended.

***Regaining Threadling Dice.*** You regain one expended *Threadling Die* when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended *Threadling Dice* after a Long Rest. Additionally, after you cast a [Mindspun Invocation] spell, you regain a number of *Threadling Die* equal to the expended spell slot.

#### Threadling Die Uses

These Threadlings are at your command. You can use your *Threadling Die* in the following way. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of *Threadling Die* that must be expended in order to use it. When the Cost states *Any*, you can expend any number of *Threadling Die* available to you.

If an effect requires a Saving Throw, it uses your Ranger's Spell Save DC.

***Seek & Destroy (Cost: Any)***

:   After you hit a creature with a weapon attack or Unarmed Strike, you can expend one or more *Threadling Die*, rolling them, and send the Threadlings at the target. The target takes extra :dmg-force: **Force** damage equal to the number rolled.

***Suspend (Cost: 1 Die)***

:   After you hit a creature with a weapon attack or Unarmed Strike, you can expend one *Threadling Die* and :dmg-force: **Force** the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it has the Restrained condition and lifted 5 feet off the ground for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***Woven Mail (Cost: Any)***

:   After you take damage, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** to expend one or more *Threadling Die*, roll them, and reduce the damage dealt to you equal to the numbers rolled.

### Level 7: Aspect of Strands

You gain new way to use your Threadlings, detailed below:

***Sever (Cost: 1 Die)***

:   When the target of your *Hunter's Mark* makes a D20 Test, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** to expend one *Threadling Die*, roll it, and subtract the target's D20 Test's result with the number rolled.

***Unravel (Cost: 1 Die)***

:   When you hit a creature with a weapon attack or Unarmed Strike, you can expend one *Threadling Die*, roll it, and rend its defences. It must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or it takes extra :dmg-force: **Force** damage equal to the number rolled and its AC is reduced by 1 until it finishes Long Rest or until you have the Incapacitated cconditon. This effect stacks. 

### Level 11: Burst of Strand

When the target of your *Hunter's Mark* or creatures affected by *Suspend* or *Unravel* subfeature dies, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** and detonate its body. Each creature within 20 feet of the point must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take :dmg-force: **Force** damage equals to a number of *Threadling Die* up to your Wisdom modifier, have the Restrained condition, and lifted 5 feet off the ground for 1 minute. On a successful save, the targets only takes half damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending 3 Threadling Die (no action required).

### Level 17: Weavewalk

You gain the ability to enter and exit the Weave at will. You always have the *[Blink]* spell prepared, and you can cast it once without expending a spell slot. When you cast *[Blink]* using this feature, it lasts for the usual duration, but instead of rolling a d6 each turn, you can choose to vanish to the Ethereal Plane or reappear on the Material Plane as a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action** on each of your turns.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you perceive the Material Plane in shades of grey and can see up to 120 feet (instead of 60 feet). When you take a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action** to vanish or reappear, you can make one weapon attack or an Unarmed Strike as part of the same Bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending 3 Threadling Dice (no action required).
