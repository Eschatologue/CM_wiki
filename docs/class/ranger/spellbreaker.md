Spellbreakers are a small but dedicated group of Rangers that specialize in hunting mages who use their arcane power for evil. While most pursue the life of a Spellbreaker for noble reasons, there are some who seek to destroy anyone with the potential to use magic. Most Spellbreakers work in secrecy, only striking when success is a certainty. If a wrong move could end in disintegration, there is no room for error.

### Level 3: Mage Breaker

You ward your weapons with antimagic enchantments. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on its :d20-save: Constitution saving throw to maintain :spell-concentration: Concentration.

Also, when you see a creature casting a spell with Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, or attempt to teleport, you can take a Reaction to make one weapon attack or one Unarmed Strike against it.

### Level 3: Spellsight

You have learned to see the arcane potential of others. When you mark a creature using :spell-level-1: *Hunter's Mark*, you instantly learn its spellcasting ability (if it has one) and the highest level spell that it has the ability to cast. If it is hidden from divination magic, such as by :spell-level-3: *Nondetection*, this feature fails.

### Level 3: Spellbreaker Magic

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Spellbreaker Spells Table, you thereaftrer always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Spellbreaker Spells

| Ranger Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | *Absorb Elements*, *Detect Magic* |
| 5 | *Blindness/Deafness*, *Silence* |
| 9 | *Counterspell*, *Dispel Magic* |
| 13 | *Arcane Eye*, *Otiluke's Resilient Sphere* |
| 17 | *Dispel Evil and Good*, *Wall of Force* |

### Level 7: Arcane Defense

You can steel yourself to better resist the magics of your foes. Whenever you are forced to make a :d20-save: saving throw to resist a spell or another magical effect, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

Moreover, whenever you are subjected you to a spell or magical effect that allows you to make a :d20-save: saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a success, and only half damage on a fail.

### Level 11: Spellbane

You are an unparalleled hunter of mages. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a level 1+ spell slot to deal bonus :dmg-force: Force damage to your target equal to 1d8 per level of the spell slot you expended. 

Moreover, when you cast *[:spell-level-3: Dispel Magic]* and you need to make a spellcasting ability check to determine the result, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10. When you cast *[:spell-level-3: Counterspell]*, your target has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on the :d20-save: saving throw.

### Level 15: Mantle of the Master

Your Spellbreaker training has reached its pinnacle. You are resistant to damage from spells and all other magical effects so long you don't have the Unconscious or Incapacitated condition.

### Level 15: Reflect Spell

Your training allows you to strike spells from the weave. You can cast :spell-level-1: *Absorb Elements* at will.

After you cast :spell-level-1: *Absorb Elements*, if your next weapon attack—melee or ranged—is against the creature whose spell you absorbed, the bonus damage from *Absorb Elements* is treated as its maximum possible amount.
