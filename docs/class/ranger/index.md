# Ranger

*Rangers are unrivalled scouts and trackers, honing a deep connection with nature in order to hunt their favoured prey.*

##### Core Ranger Trait

| Trait | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Primary Ability** | Strength/Dexterity, and Wisdom |
| **Hit Point Die** | D10 per Ranger level |
| **Saving Throw Proficiencies** | Strength and Dexterity |

Far from the bustle of cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch.

Wanderers of the wilderness, Rangers specialize in facing monsters that threaten the world. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness the primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus on the task of protecting the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

!!! homebrew "Not Official"

    This version of Ranger is a modified version of the 2024 PHB. Some changes are made to buff ranger's to be more appealing as a class.

### Level 1: Favoured Enemy

You always have the ***Hunter's Mark*** spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favoured Enemy column of the Ranger Features table. When the spell is cast this way, it does not require :spell-concentration: Concentration, though it ends early if you have the ^^Incapacitated^^ condition.

### Level 1: Ranger's Aptitude

You gain invaluable knowledge, experiences, or hard-earned lessons, which is represented by Ranger's Aptidude. You gain one aptidude of your choice. Aptidude are described in the "[Ranger's Aptitude Options](../../option/class-options/ranger-aptitude.md)" section later in this class's description.

***Prerequisites.*** If an aptidude has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that aptidude. For example, if an aptidude requires you to be a level 5+ Ranger, you can select the aptidude once you reach Ranger level 5.

***Replacing and Gaining Aptidudes.*** Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of your aptidudes with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an aptidude if it's a prerequisite for another aptidude that you have.

***Spell.*** If an aptidude grants a spell, it is considered a Ranger spell for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability.

***Proficiency.*** If an aptidude grants proficiency in a skill you already have, choose a different proficiency available to the [Core Ranger Trait](#core-ranger-trait) table:

When you gain certain Ranger levels, you gain more aptidudes of your choice, as shown in the Aptidudes column of the Ranger Features table.

You can't pick the same aptidude more than once unless its description says otherwise.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](../../spells/class-specific/ranger.md) later in the class's description.

#### Spell Slots

The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. *[:spell-level-1: Cure Wounds]* and *[:spell-level-1: Ensnaring Strike]* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

[:spell-level-1: Cure Wounds]: ../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#cure-wounds
[:spell-level-1: Ensnaring Strike]: ../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#ensnaring-strike

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:ability-wis: **Wisdom** is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can do one of the following:

***Change Weapon***  
You can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords, or

**Replace Weapon Mastery^*CM*^**  
You can choose any of the kinds of Mastery weapons you're using and replace the Mastery property of each with another Mastery property. The chosen kind of weapon must qualify for the new property. For example, you could replace the Scimitar's Nick property with the Vex property.
