# Ranger

Far from the bustle of cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch.

Wanderers of the wilderness, Rangers specialize in facing monsters that threaten the world. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness the primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus on the task of protecting the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

## Creating a Ranger

To create a Ranger, consult the following lists, which provide Hit Points, proficiencies, and armor training.

### Hit Point

- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Ranger level
- **Hit Points at Level 1:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points per later Level:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier

### Proficiencies

- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity
- **Skills (Choose 2):** Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, Survival
- **Weapons:** Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons
- **Tools:** None

### Armour Training

Light Armor, Medium Armor, Shields

### Starting Equipment

As a Level 1 character, you start with the following equipment
 
- Arrows (20)
- Druidic Focus (Sprig of Mistletoe)
- Explorer’s Pack 
- Longbow or Shortbow
- Quiver, Scimitar, & Shortsword
- Studded Leather Armor 
- 70 SP

Or you can forgo it and spend 1500 SP on equipment of your choice.

## Level 1: Deft Explorer

You are an unsurpassed explorer. Choose one of your proficiencies in a skill that appears on the Ranger skill list. You gain Expertise in that skill.

In addition, choose two types of terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. You have Advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks about the chosen terrains, and you have Advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track creatures in them.
 
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can meditate and replace one of the chosen terrain types with a different one from the list.

## Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Ranger.

### Spell Slots

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level.** You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two 1st-level spells from the Ranger spell list. Rather than choosing, you may start with Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Ranger spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of 1st or level 2, in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells 

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your Spellcasting Ability for your Ranger spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you prepare for this class.

## Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Longswords.
 
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the Mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

## Level 2: Favored Enemy

You are adept at focusing on a single foe. You always have the Hunter’s Mark spell prepared. You can cast it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 2: Fighting Style

You have honed your martial prowess. You gain one of the following Fighting Style feats of your choice: Archery, Defense, Dueling, or Two- Weapon Fighting.

## Level 3: Ranger Subclass

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice: 

- Beast Master
- Fey Wanderer
- Gloom Stalker
- Hunter

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level and lower.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement](../../character-creation/feat/feat-4th-level.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

As shown on the Ranger table, you gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.

## Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Level 6: Roving

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy Armor.

You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.
 
## Level 9: EXpertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

## Level 9: Deft Explorer Improvement

Choose one of your proficiencies in a skill that appears on the Ranger skill list. You gain Expertise in that skill.

In addition, choose two more terrain types for your Deft Explorer feature.

## Level 10: Tireless

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits:

**Temporary Hit Points.** As an action, you can give yourself a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Decrease Exhaustion.** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

## Level 14: Nature’S Veil

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself from view. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
 
## Level 17: Precise Hunter

Propelled by primal spirits, you always have Advantage against creature affected by Hunter's Mark spell

## Level 18: Feral Senses

Your connection to the forces of nature grants you Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

## Level 20: Foe Slayer

You become an unparalleled hunter of your foes. When your attack roll misses the target of your Hunter’s Mark, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll, potentially turning it into a hit.
In addition, whenever you hit that target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage.
