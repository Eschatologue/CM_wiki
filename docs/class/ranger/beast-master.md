# Beast Master Conclave

A Beast Master ranger forms a mystical bond with a special beast, drawing on primal magic and a deep attunement to the natural world.

### Level 3: Primal Companion

You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. Choose its stat block—[Beast of the Land], [Beast of the Sea], or [Beast of the Sky]—which uses your Proficiency Bonus (PB) in several places. You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its supernatural origin.

The beast is Firendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes when you die.

***The Beast in Combat.*** In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes its the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to combat it to take an action in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Beast's Strike action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the beast acts on its own and isn't limited to the Dodge action.

***Restoring or Replacing the Beast.*** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The beast reutrns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unccoupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast form from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.

[Beast of the Land]: #beast-of-the-land
[Beast of the Sea]: #beast-of-the-sea
[Beast of the Sky]: #beast-of-the-sky

### Level 7: Exceptional Training

When you use your Bonus Action to command your Primal Companion beast to take an action, you can also command it to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action as a Bonus Action.

In addition, whenever the beast hits with an attack and deals damage, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

### Level 11: Bestial Fury

When you command your Primal Companion beast to take the Attack action, the beast can use it twice.

In addition, the first time each turn it hits a creature under the effect of your ***Hunter's Mark*** spell, the beast deals extra Force damage equal to the bonus damage of that spell.

### Level 15: Share Spells

When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your Primal Companion beast with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.
