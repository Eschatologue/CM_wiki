# Gloom Stalker Conclave

Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places, wielding magic drawn from the Shadowfell to combat enemies that lurk in darkness.

## Level 3: Gloom Stalker Magic

## Level 3: Dread Ambusher

You have mastered the art of creating frightening ambushes, granting you the following benefits:

**Ambusher’s Leap.** At the start of the first turn of each combat, your Speed increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

**Frighten.** Once per turn when you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra 1d8 Psychic damage to the target and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, it has the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Initiative Bonus.** When you roll Initiative, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.

## Level 3: Umbral Sight

You gain Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on Darkvision. While entirely in Darkness, you have the Invisible condition to any creature that relies on Darkvision to see you in that darkness.

## Level 7: Iron Mind

You have honed your ability to resist the mind- altering powers of your prey. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).
 
## Level 11: Stalker’S Flurry

When you use the Frighten effect of your Dread Ambusher feature, you can cause one of the following additional effects:

**Sudden Strike**. You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon’s range.

**Mass Fear.** Each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition until the start of your next turn.

## Level 17: Shadowy Dodge

You can dodge with wisps of supernatural shadow around you. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your Reaction to impose Disadvantage on that roll. If the attack then misses, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
