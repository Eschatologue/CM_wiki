# Monster Slayer Conclave

> *Study and Slay Monsters*

You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A Monster Slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.

### Level 3: Monster Slayer Spells 

Your training to hunt monsters ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Ranger level specified in the Monster Slayer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Monster Slayer Spells

| Ranger Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Bane], [:spell-lv1: Protection from Evil and Good] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam], [:spell-lv2: See Invisibility] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Magic Circle], [:spell-lv3: Protection from Energy] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Banishment], [:spell-lv4: Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Dispel Evil and Good], [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster] |

### Level 3: Slayer's Prey

*You hunt most effectively when focussing your ire on a single target.*

Your [:spell-lv1: Hunter's Mark] spell improves in the following ways:

***Slayer's Strike.*** Once per turn when you deal the extra damage of your Hunter's Mark, the damage increases by 1d6.

***Hunter's Sense.*** When you mark a creature, you immediately learn whether it has any damage :dmg-imm: Immunities, :dmg-res: Resistances, or :dmg-vul: Vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from Divination magic, you sense that it has no damage :dmg-imm: Immunities, :dmg-res: Resistances, or :dmg-vul: Vulnerabilities.

### Level 3: Slayer's Cunning

You are always prepared to hunt. You gain the [:class-phb24-ranger: Slayer I](../../option/class-options/ranger-aptitude.md#slayer-i) Aptitude.

### Level 7: Supernatural Defense

*You gain extra resilience against your prey's assaults on your mind and body.*

Whenever the target of your [:spell-lv1: Hunter's Mark] forces you to make a, ability check or saving throw, you gain a bonus to your roll equal to 1d6. This bonus increases when you reach level 13 (d8) and level 20 (d10).

### Level 11: Slayer's Prey Improvement

Your [:spell-lv1: Hunter's Mark] spell improves in the following ways:

***Bypass.*** Your attacks Weapon attack and Unarmed Strike against the spell's target ignores the target's :dmg-res: Resistance, and :dmg-imm: Immunity is treated as :dmg-res: Resistance.

***Slayer's Strike Improvement.*** The extra damage of your Slayer's Strike increases to 2d6.

### Level 15: Slayer's Counter

*You gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you.*

When you see your the target of your [:spell-lv1: Hunter's Mark] attempt to cast a spell, teleport, or use another supernatural or magical ability from its stat block, you can make a single weapon attack against it as a reaction. On hit, the spell's target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC, or its spell, teleport, or other ability is thwarted and fails to take effect.

When you use this feature and your attack hits, you can choose to instantly end [:spell-lv1: Hunter's Mark] to cause the creature to automatically fail its Wisdom saving throw.
