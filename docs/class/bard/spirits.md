# College of Spirits

> *Consult Spirits for Stories and Guidance*

Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power—be they legends, histories, or fictions— and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these Bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a Bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.

### Level 3: Spirit Medium

You employ tools that aid you in channeling spirits, be they historical figures or fictional archetypes.

**Spiritual Focus**{.inl} You can use the following objects as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells: a candle, crystal ball, skull, spirit board, or tarokka deck. Musical Instruments that you are proficient with also counts as a Spiritual Focus.

**Guiding Whispers**{.inl} You can reach out to spirits to guide you and others. You learn the [:spell-lv0: Guidance] cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of Bard cantrips you know. When you cast it while holding your Spiritual Focus, it has a range of 60 feet.

### Level 3: Tales from Beyond

You reach out to spirits who tell their tales through you. 

While you are holding your Spiritual Focus, you can use a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Spirit Tales table using your Bardic Inspiration die to determine the tale the spirits direct you to tell. You retain the tale in mind until you bestow the tale's effect or you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

You can use a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action to choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (this can be you) to be the target of the tale's effect. Once you do so, you can't bestow the tale's effect again until you roll it again.

You can retain only one of these tales in mind at a time, and rolling on the Spirit Tales table immediately ends the effect of the previous tale. If the tale requires a saving throw, the DC equals your spell save DC.

##### Spirit Tales

| Bardic Die | Tale Told Through You |
|:-:|---|
| 1 | **Tale of the Clever Animal**{.inl} For the next 10 minutes, whenever the target makes an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check, the target can roll an extra die immediately after rolling the d20 and add the extra die's number to the check. The extra die is the same type as your Bardic Inspiration die. |
| 2 | **Tale of the Renowned Duelist**{.inl} You make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **(Bardic Die + Charisma modifier):dmg-force: Force**{.dmg-force} damage. |
| 3 | **Tale of the Beloved Friends**{.inl} The target and another creature of its choice it can see within 5 feet of it gains **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Charisma modifier. |
| 4 | **Tale of the Runaway**{.inl} The target can immediately take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to Teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the target Teleports, it can choose a number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0) to immediately take the same Reaction. |
| 5 | **Tale of the Avenger**{.inl} For 1 minute, any creature that hits the target with a melee attack takes **(Bardic Die) :dmg-force: Force**{.dmg-force}. |
| 6 | **Tale of the Traveler**{.inl} The target gains **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Bard level. While it has these Temporary Hit Points, the target's Speed increases by 10 feet and it gains a +1 bonus to its AC. |
| 7 | **Tale of the Beguiler**{.inl} The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take Psychic damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die, and the target has the Incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn. |
| 8 | **Tale of the Phantom**{.inl} The target has the Invisible condition until the end of its next turn or until it hits a creature with an attack. If the target hits a creature with an attack during this invisibility, the creature it hits takes Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Bardic Inspiration die and has the Frightened condition until the end of the frightened creature's next turn, with the attacker serving as the source of the fear. |
| 9 | **Tale of the Brute**{.inl} Each creature of the target's choice it can see within 30 feet of it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Thunder damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and has the Prone condition. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't Prone. |
| 10 | **Tale of the Dragon**{.inl} The target spews fire from the mouth in a 30-foot Cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking Fire damage equal to four rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 11 | **Tale of the Angel**{.inl} The target regains Hit Points equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier, and you end one condition from the following list affecting the target: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned or Stunned. |
| 12 | **Tale of the Mind-Bender**{.inl} You evoke an incomprehensible fable from an otherworldly being. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take Psychic damage equal to three rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die and have the Stunned condition until the end of its next turn. |

### Level 6: Empowered Spiritual Focus

When you cast a Bard spell that deals damage or restores Hit Points while you are holding your Spiritual Focus, roll a d6, and you gain a bonus to one damage or healing roll of the spell equal to the number rolled.

### Level 6: Spirit Session

Spirits provide you with supernatural insights. You can conduct an hour-long ritual channeling spirits (which can be done during a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**) using your Spiritual Focus.

**Ritual Participants**{.inl} You can conduct the ritual with a number of willing creatures equal to half your Bard level (rounded down, maximum 9, including yourself).

**Spell Knowledge**{.inl} At the end of the ritual, you temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class. The spell you choose must be of a level equal to the number of creatures that conducted the ritual or less, the spell must be of a level you can cast, and it must be in the school of Divination or Necromancy. You always have the spell prepared until you use this feature again.

**Once per Long Rest**{.inl} Once you perform the ritual, you can't do so again until you start a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 14: Mystical Connection

You now have the ability to nudge the spirits of Tales from Beyond toward certain tales. Whenever you roll on the Spirit Tales table, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two effects to bestow. If you roll the same number on both dice, you can ignore the number and choose any effect on the table.
