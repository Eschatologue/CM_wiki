# College of Valour

> *Sing the Deeds of Ancient Hero*
 
Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present, in vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.

### Level 3: Combat Inspiration

You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects:

***Defense.*** When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.

***Offense.*** Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack's damage against the target.

### Level 3: Martial Training

You gain proficiency with Martial Weapons and armour training with Medium Armour and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a spellcasting focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

### Level 14: Battle Magic

After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.
