# College of Dance

*Move in HARMONY with the Cosmos*

Bards of the College of Dance know that the Words of Creation can't be contained within speech or even song; they are uttered by the movements of celestial bodies and flow through the motions of even the smallest creatures. To these Bards, dance is art freed from the constraints of a single point in space and time; it is meaning unconfined by narrow definitions of words and structures of grammar. The College of Dance practices a way of being in harmony with the ever-whirling cosmos, emphasizing agility, speed, and grace.

### Level 3: Dazzling Footwork

While you aren't wearing armour or wielding a Shield, you gain the following benefits:

***Dance Virtuoso.*** You have Advantage on any Charisma (Perfomance) check you make that involves dancing.

***Unarmoured Defense.*** Your base Armour Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

***Agile Strikes.*** When you expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration as part of an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction, you can make one Unarmed Strike as part of that action, Bonus Action, or Reaction.
 
***Bardic Damage.*** You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. When you deal damage with an Unarmed Strike, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die plus your Dexterity modifier. This roll doesn't expend the die.

### Level 6: Inspiring Movement

When an enemy you can see ends its turn within 5 feet of you, you can use your Reaction and expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to move up to half your Speed. Then one ally of your choice within 30 feet of you can also move up to half their Speed using their Reaction.

None of this feature's movement provokes Opportunity Attacks.

### Level 6: Tandem Footwork

When you roll Initiative, you can spend one use of your Bardic Inspiration if you don't have the Incapacitated condition. When you do so, roll your Bardic Inspiration die; you and each ally within 30 fwwr of you who can see or hear you gains a bonus to their Initiative equal to the number rolled.

### Level 14: Leading Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If any creature within 5 feet of you are making the same Dexterity saving throw, you can share this benefit with them for that save.

You can't use this feature if you have the Incapacited condition.
