- 260 SP
 
Or you can forgo it and spend 1000 SP on equipment of your choice.

## Level 1: Bardic Inspiration

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.
Using Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet
 
of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
Once within the next hour when the creature fails a d20 Test, the creature can roll that die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard table. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

## Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Bard.

### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from your Bard spell list.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from your Bard spell list.
When you reach 4th and 10th level in this class, you learn another cantrip of your choice from your Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard table.

### Spell Slots

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level. You prepare the list of spells of 1st level and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four 1st-level spells from your Bard spell list.

The number of spells on your list also increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared
 
**Spells column of the Bard table.** Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from your Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells on the list you prepare with this Spellcasting feature, but those spells otherwise follow the rules in this feature.

### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another spell for which you have spell slots and that is on your Bard spell list.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for your Bard spells.

### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for the spells you cast with your Bard features.

## Level 2: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance and Persuasion are iconic choices for a Bard if you have proficiency in them.

## Level 2: Jack Of All Trades

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

## Level 3: Bard Subclass

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice: 

- College of Dance
- College of Glamour
- College of Lore 
- College of Valor

A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level and lower.

## Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [Ability Score Improvement](../../feat/feat-4th-level.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

As shown on the Bard table, you gain this feature again at levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.
 
## Level 5: Font Of Inspiration

You now also regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short Rest.

In addition, if you have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required). You can do so only once per turn.

## Level 6: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Bard subclass.

## Level 7: Countercharm

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can use your Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

## Level 9: Expertise

You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

## Level 10: Magical Secrets

You have collected magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. As a result, your Bard spell list now includes the Arcane, Divine, and Primal spell lists.

## Level 12: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

## Level 14: Subclass Feature

You gain a feature from your Bard subclass.

## Level 18: Superior Inspiration

When you roll Initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain two expended uses of it..

## Level 20: Words Of Creation

You have mastered two of the prime Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill spells prepared, and when you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with the spell, provided that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.
