# College of Swords

> *Turn Combat Mastery into a Performance*

Known simply as Blades, the Bards that are in these Colleges are famous for their wondrous, yet deadly performances that incorporate bladed weapons. Far from mundane performers, these Bards use their skill with blades to find employment as duelists, vigilantes, and sometimes even turn to adventuring.

### Level 3: Fighting Style

You can select one of the Fighting Style feats of your choice. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange your selection for another option.

### Level 3: Martial Training

Your experience in martial combat has granted you training in Medium armour and proficiency with Martial melee weapons that have the :weapon-prop-finesse: **Finesse** or :weapon-prop-light: **Light** property. You can use weapons that you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your Bard spells and to perform its Somatic components.

Moreover, your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of one kind of Simple or Martial weapon with which you have proficiency. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kind of weapon you chose to another eligible kind.

### Level 3: Blade Flourish

Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, your walking speed increases by 10 feet until the end of the turn, and if a weapon attack that you make as part of this action hits a creature, you can use one of the following Blade Flourish options of your choice. You can use only one Blade Flourish option per turn.

***Defensive Flourish.*** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You also add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.

***Slashing Flourish.*** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit and to any number of other creatures of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of you. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

***Mobile Flourish.*** You can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target you hit. The damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. You can also push the target up to a number of feet equal to three times the number you roll on that die, rounded to the nearest 5 foot increment. You can then immediately take a Reaction to move up to your Speed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target.

### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your cantrip that has the casting time of an action in place of those attack.

### Level 6: Blade Technique (Optional)

You gain additional method to use your Bardic Inspiration as follow:

***Counter Flourish.***  When a creature you can see misses you with a melee attack, you take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and make a single melee weapon attack against your attacker. On hit, you add the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die to the damage roll of that attack.

***Piercing Flourish.*** As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and take the Dash action. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the Attack action on this turn, the attack deals extra damage equals the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

### Level 14: Masterâ€™s Flourish

Whenever you use a Blade Flourish or a Blade Technique options, you can roll a d6 and use it instead of expending a Bardic Inspiration die.
