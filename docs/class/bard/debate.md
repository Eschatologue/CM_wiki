# College of Debate

Bards of the College of Debate view rhetoric as a weapon. They don't merely persuadeâ€”they dismantle, deconstruct, and devastate opposition with words alone. Known for their logical precision and mental agility, these bards thrive in situations where they can engage in rapid exchanges, battering foes with their unassailable logic.

### Level 3: Debater's Implement

Your sharp retorts can disrupt and unnerve your opponents in the heat of battle.

You have the *True Strike* and *Vicious Mockery* cantrips always prepared. You can choose to change their damage type to :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage whenever you cast them.

### Level 3: Engaging Discourse

You can drag a creature into a mentally exhausting debate, wearing it down with your relentless arguments.

As a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to target a creature within 60 feet. The creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or, it takes :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage equal to your Bardic die and becomes locked in debate with you so long you and the target are within 60 feet and either of you has the Incapacitated condition.

While in the debate, the target suffers the following effects:

***Silenced.*** The target has the Silenced condition.

***Constant Damage.*** At the end of each of its turns, the target takes :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage equal to your Bardic die.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. You can also choose to end the debate early (no action required)

Only one target can be in a debate at any given time.

### Level 6: Relentless Logic

Your unyielding arguments wear down even the most resolute minds, leaving them confused and vulnerable. 

When you deal :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage to a creature, you can impose one of the following effects to that creature (your choice):

***Doubtful Step.*** The target's :rsc-speed: Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***Clouded Judgement.*** The target has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws until the start of your next turn.

***Flabberfasted.*** The target has the Silenced condition until the start of your next turn.

### Level 14: Infallible Logic

Your mind has become a bastion of reason and self-rightousness, giving you the following benefits:

***Resistance.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage.

***Saving Throw Bonus.*** You gain bonus to your Intelligence and Wisdom saving throw equals to your Charisma modifier.

***Psychic Retort.*** When you cast a spell that deals :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage, it deals extra :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage equal to your Bardic Die.
