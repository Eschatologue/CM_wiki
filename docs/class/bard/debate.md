# College of Debate

Bards of the College of Debate view rhetoric as a weapon. They don’t merely persuade—they dismantle, deconstruct, and devastate opposition with words alone. Known for their logical precision and mental agility, these bards thrive in situations where they can engage in rapid exchanges, battering foes with their unassailable logic.

### Level 3: Debater's Rebuttal

Your sharp retorts can disrupt and unnerve your opponents in the heat of battle.

You have the *True Strike* and *Vicious Mockery* cantrips always prepared. You can choose to change their damage type to :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage whenever you cast them.

Additionally, when a creature within 60 feet of you makes a D20 Test, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from its D20 Test result.

### Level 3: Facts and Logic

You’re a master at producing arguments that sound airtight, even if they’re a bit improvised. When you make a Charisma (Deception), Charisma (Intimidation), or Charisma (Persuasion) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8.

### Level 6: Relentless Logic

Your unyielding arguments wear down even the most resolute minds, leaving them confused and vulnerable. 

When you deal :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage to a creature, you can impose one of the following effects to that creature (your choice):

***Doubtful Step.*** The target’s :rsc-speed: Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***Clouded Judgement.*** The target has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws until the start of your next turn.

***Flabberfasted.*** The target has the Silenced condition until the start of your next turn.

### Level 14: Infallible Logic

Your mind has become a bastion of reason and self-rightousness, giving you the following benefits:

***Resistance.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage.

***Saving Throw Bonus.*** You gain bonus to your Intelligence and Wisdom saving throw equals to your Charisma modifier.

***Psychic Slap.*** When you cast a spell that deals :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage, it deals extra :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage equal to your Bardic Die.
