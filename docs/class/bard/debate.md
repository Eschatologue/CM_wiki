# College of Debate

Bards of the College of Debate view rhetoric as a weapon. They don’t merely persuade—they dismantle, deconstruct, and devastate opposition with words alone. Known for their logical precision and mental agility, these bards thrive in situations where they can engage in rapid exchanges, battering foes with their unassailable logic.

### Level 3: Debater's Implement

Your sharp retorts can disrupt and unnerve your opponents in the heat of battle.

You have the *True Strike* and *Vicious Mockery* cantrips always prepared. You can choose to change their damage type to :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage whenever you cast them.
This looks fantastic—very clear, effective, and thematically on-point. Here’s a polished version with minor wording adjustments for clarity:

### Level 3: Engaging Discourse

You can drag a creature into a mentally exhausting debate, wearing it down with your relentless arguments.

As a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to target a creature within 60 feet. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, it takes :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die and becomes locked in debate with you.

While in the debate, the target suffers the following effects:

***Silenced.*** The target is unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components.

***Constant Damage.*** At the end of each of its turns, the target takes :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Level 6: Relentless Logic

Your unyielding arguments wear down even the most resolute minds, leaving them confused and vulnerable. 

When you deal :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage to a creature, you can impose one of the following effects to that creature (your choice):

***Doubtful Step.*** The target’s :rsc-speed: Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

***Clouded Judgement.*** The target has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws until the start of your next turn.

***Flabberfasted.*** The target has the Silenced condition until the start of your next turn.

### Level 14: Infallible Logic

Your mind has become a bastion of reason and self-rightousness, giving you the following benefits:

***Resistance.*** You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage.

***Saving Throw Bonus.*** You gain bonus to your Intelligence and Wisdom saving throw equals to your Charisma modifier.

***Psychic Slap.*** When you cast a spell that deals :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage, it deals extra :dmg-psychic: **Psychic** damage equal to your Bardic Die.
