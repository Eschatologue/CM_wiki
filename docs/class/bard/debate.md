# College of Debate

> *Wear Your Opponent with Facts and Logic*

Bards of the College of Debate view rhetoric as a weapon. They don't merely persuadeâ€”they dismantle, deconstruct, and devastate opposition with words alone. Known for their logical precision and mental agility, these bards thrive in situations where they can engage in rapid exchanges, battering foes with their unassailable logic.

### Level 3: Debater's Implement

Your sharp retorts can disrupt and unnerve your opponents in the heat of battle. You gain the following benefits:

**Debate Cantrip**{ .inl } You have the [:spell-lv0: Vicious Mockery] cantrips always prepared. You can add your Charisma modifier to this cantrip's damage and the spell's target still takes half damage whenever they succeed its saving throw.

**Seething Words**{ .inl } When you deal **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } damage from a spell or class feature, it ignores **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em }. Creature that are immune to **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } damage still takes half damage. 

### Level 3: Engaging Discourse

You can drag a creature into a mentally exhausting debate, wearing it down with your relentless arguments.

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to target a creature within 60 feet. The creature must succeed a **:d20-save: Wisdom saving throw**{ .d20 } against your Spell Save DC or it becomes locked in debate with you so long you and the target are within 60 feet and either of you has the Incapacitated condition. At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

While in the debate, when the target makes a D20 Test, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to deal **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } damage to the target. The damage is equal to your Bardic Die.

Only one target can be in a debate at any given time, choosing a different target will end the most recent debate.

### Level 6: Relentless Logic

Your unyielding arguments wear down even the most resolute minds, leaving them confused and vulnerable. 

Targets that are under the effect of ^^Engaging Discourse^^ is also under the effect of the [:spell-lv4: Confusion](../../spells/description/core/level-4.md#confusion) spell.

### Level 14: Infallible Logic

Your mind has become a bastion of reason and self-rightousness, giving you the following benefits:

**Resistance**{ .inl } You have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } damage.

**Saving Throw Bonus**{ .inl } You gain bonus to your Intelligence and Wisdom saves equals to your Charisma modifier.
