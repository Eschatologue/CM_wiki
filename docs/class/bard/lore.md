# College of Lore

Bards of the College of Lore plumb the depths of magical knowledge, collecting spells and secrets from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college's members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

### Level 3: Cutting Words

You learn how to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration, roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature's roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

### Level 6: Magical Discoveries

You learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know.

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets the requirements above.

### Level 14: Peerless Skill

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn't expended.
