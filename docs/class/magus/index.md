Known by many names, those who are able to wield both sword and spell are collectively known as Magi. Rather than dedicate their lives to studying arcane magic or mastering martial techniques, Magi are dedicated to a middle path. Though they may never command the earth-shattering magic of an archmage, or go toe to toe with a true master of the blade, a Magus is able to master a unique form of arcane combat only used by the members of their Order.

Their signature style of magic allows them to channel spells through their weapon strikes, sense the presence of arcane magic in the world around them, and even strike the weaves of spells from the air before they can take effect.

### Level 1: Arcane Armory

You learn the signature enchantment of the Magi, marking you as a member of their ranks. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest, you can touch one melee weapon, shield, or set of armor to perform a ritual adding the item to your Arcane Armory. Your Arcane Armory is an extradimensional space that only its Magus can access.

Objects in your Arcane Armory gain the following benefits:

- They count as magical weapons, shields, or sets of armor.
- You can use your Intelligence, in place of Dexterity, when calculating Armor Class in this light and medium armor, so long as you do not already add it to your Armor Class.
- As a Bonus Action, you can shunt or summon any number of objects of your choice from within your Arcane Armory, instantly equipping, donning, or doffing those items.

Your Arcane Armory can hold a total number of objects equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1) at one time, but one of those objects must always be a weapon. If you perform this ritual on another object while the Armory is at its maximum, one object of your choice is removed.

!!! warning "Arcane Armory & Antimagic Effects"

    The effects of the antimagic field spell, and other similar effects, suppress the effects of your Arcane Armory while you are within the area of anitmagic.

### Level 1: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5 for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

***Arcane Warrior.*** You learn two Wizard cantrips of your choice (see the Wizard class’s section for a list of Wizard spells). The chosen cantrips count as Magus spells for you, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Magus level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Wizard cantrip.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast arcane spells, much like a Wizard, which you use to enhance your abilities in combat. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Magus spells, which appear in the [Magus spell list](../../spells/class-specific/magus.md) later in the class's description.

#### Cantrips 

You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Magus spell list].

Whenever you gain an Magus level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the [Magus spell list].

#### Spell Slots

The Magus Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Magus spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Magus levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Magus Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Magus spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Magus Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Magus, your list of prepared spells can include six Magus spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Magus feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Magus spells for you.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Magus spell for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Magus spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use any weapon or shield within your Arcane Armory as a spellcasting focus for your Magus spells. They can also be used to perform the somatic components of Magus spells.

You can also use an Arcane Focus as a spellcasting focus.

### Level 2: Spellstrike

You learn to channel your spells through weapons. Once per turn when you would make an attack, you can cast a Magus spell, expending a spell slot as normal, and make an attack with a melee Arcane Armory weapon. To be channeled through a Spellstrike attack in this way, the spell must meet the following requirements:

- The Magus spell must have a casting time of an Action.
- The Magus spell must require a single spell attack roll, force its target to make a saving throw, or affect a total number of hit points worth of creatures (like *Sleep*).

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately after the normal effects and damage of your weapon attack, using the rules below:

#### Area of Effect

If the spell targets an area greater than a 10-foot cube, it takes effect as a 15-foot cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice on hit).

#### Cantrips

You do not deal the damage of the cantrip along with the damage of your weapon attack. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip's additional effects, other than damage, on hit.

#### Concentration

If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.

#### Saving Throws

If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the initial saving throw at disadvantage on hit. If you score a critical hit on the attack, it automatically fails this saving throw. Other targets (if any) save as normal.

#### Spell Attacks

If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it instantly takes effect when you hit with your weapon attack.

### Level 3: Arcane Regeneration

You can meditate on your knowledge of the arcane to regenerate magic potential. When you finish a Short Rest, you can recover spell slots of a combined level equal to your Intelligence modifier. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Magus level 8, 12, 16, and 19.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

You can still only make one Spellstrike attack per turn.

### Level 5: Spellsight

You can use an action awaken your senses to the presence of magic within 30 feet as if you had cast detect magic. While this sense is active, you can touch an object and gain knowledge as if you had cast identify. This special sense requires your concentration, and it lasts for 1 minute.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 6: Ethereal Jaunt

You can focus residual power from spells to slip through the Ethereal Plane. On your turn, immediately before or after you cast a Magus spell or Spellstrike, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet.

The range of this feature is 10 feet, plus an extra 10 feet for each level of the spell slot you expended (maximum 60 feet).

### Level 9: Spellsunder

You can use Spellstrike to cut down hostile spells. When you see a creature cast a spell that will affect you, you can take a Reaction to expend a spell slot and use an Arcane Armory weapon to attack the spell as it takes effect.

If the spell was cast at a level equal to the level of the spell slot you expended or lower, the spell fails and has no effect. If it was cast at a level higher than the slot you expended, make an attack roll with your weapon. If your attack roll exceeds 12 + twice the level of the spell, the spell fails and has no effect.

### Level 10: Mystical Ward

You can cast your spells in battle and avoid their most potent effects. You are immune to the effects of any Magus spell you cast, unless you wish to be affected.

### Level 11: Arcane Conservation

When you use Spellstrike and miss with your weapon attack, you can regain one expended spell slot. When you do so, you cannot also use Ethereal Jaunt.

The spell slot you regain with this feature must be a lower level than the slot you expended as part of your Spellstrike.

At Level 18, you regain the same spell slot you expended.

### Level 11: Prismatic Strikes

Your weapons are infused with the arcane power you channel through them. Your attacks with Arcane Armory weapons deal a bonus 1d8 damage on hit.

This bonus damage must be the damage type dealt by a Magus spell you know, and it can be chosen on hit.

### Level 14: Superior Spellsunder

When a creature you can see within 30 feet is targeted by a spell you can see, you can take a Reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it and use your Spellsunder reaction against the triggering spell.
