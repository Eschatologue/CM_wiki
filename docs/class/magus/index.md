# Magus

> *To face a Magus, is to experience the flurry of both spells and blades.*

Feared and respected by many, those who wield both blade and spell are collectively known as Magi. Rather than commit their lives solely to the study of arcane lore or the perfection of martial prowess, the Magi walk a path between the two. They may never unleash the cataclysmic power of an archmage nor rival the raw skill of a seasoned swordmaster, but a Magus commands the art of blending magic with steel, forging a deadly and elegant form of arcane combat known only to their Order.

With this unique discipline, they channel their spells through their weapons, fusing magic with every strike. Their heightened senses can detect the weave of arcane energy in the world around them, and they can even sever spells from the air before they even manifest.

### Level 1: Arcane Armoury

You learn the signature enchantment of the Magi, marking you as a member of their ranks. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be during a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can touch one melee weapon, shield, or set of armour to perform a ritual adding the item to your **Arcane Armoury**. Your Arcane Armoury is an extradimensional space that only its Magus can access.

Objects in your **Arcane Armoury** gain the following benefits:

- They count as Magical Weapons, Shields, or sets of Armour.
- You can use your Intelligence, in place of Dexterity, when calculating Armour Class in this Light and Medium armour, so long as you do not already add it to your Armour Class.
- As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can shunt or summon any number of objects of your choice from within your Arcane Armoury, instantly equipping, donning, or doffing those items.

Your Arcane Armoury can hold a total number of objects equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1) at one time, but one of those objects must always be a weapon. If you perform this ritual on another object while the Armoury is at its maximum, one object of your choice is removed.

!!! warning "Arcane Armoury & Antimagic Effects"

    The effects of the antimagic field spell, and other similar effects, suppress the effects of your Arcane Armoury while you are within the area of antimagic.

### Level 1: Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see chapter 5 for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**Arcane Warrior**{ .inl } You learn two Wizard cantrips of your choice (see the Wizard class's section for a list of Wizard spells). The chosen cantrips count as Magus spells for you, and Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Magus level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Wizard cantrip.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast arcane spells, much like a Wizard, which you use to enhance your abilities in combat. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Magus spells, which appear in the [Magus Spell List] later in the class's description.

#### Cantrips 

You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Magus Spell List].

Whenever you gain an Magus level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Magus Spell List.

#### Spell Slots

The Magus Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Magus spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Magus levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Magus Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Magus spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Magus Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Magus, your list of prepared spells can include six Magus spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Magus feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Magus spells for you.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can replace one spell on your list with another Magus spell for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:abl-int: **Intelligence** is your spellcasting ability for your Magus spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use any Weapon or Shield within your Arcane Armoury as a spellcasting focus for your Magus spells. They can also be used to perform the Somatic components of Magus spells.

You can also use an Arcane Focus as a spellcasting focus.

### Level 2: Spellstrike

You learn to channel your spells through weapons. Once per turn, when you make an attack with a melee weapon from your Arcane Armoury, you can cast a Magus spell by expending a spell slot. The spell must meet the following criteria:

- The Magus spell must have a casting time of an Action.
- The Magus spell must require a single spell attack roll, force its target to make a saving throw, or affect a total number of hit points worth of creatures (like [:spell-lv1: Sleep]).

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately after the normal effects and damage of your weapon attack, using the rules below:

**:aoe-rad: Area of Effect**{ .inl } If the spell targets an area greater than a 10-foot Cube, it takes effect as a 15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice on hit).
{ .indt }

**:spell-lv0: Cantrips**{ .inl } The Cantrip does not deal damage. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip's additional effects, other than damage, on hit.
{ .indt }

**:spell-conc: Concentration**{ .inl } If the spell requires your Concentration, you must Concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.
{ .indt }

**:d20-save: Saving Throw**{ .inl } If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the first save at a **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on hit. On a Critical Hit, the target automatically fails the save. Other target (if any) make this save as normal.
{ .indt }

**:d20-attack: Attack Roll**{ .inl } If the spell requires an attack roll, it instantly take effect when you hit with a weapon attack.
{ .indt }

### Level 3: Arcane Regeneration

You can meditate on your knowledge of the arcane to regenerate magic potential. When you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, you can recover spell slots of a combined level equal to your Intelligence modifier. 

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 3: Magus Subclass

You gain a Magus subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Magus levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Magus level or lower.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#abl-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Magus level 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action on your turn.

You can still only make one [Spellstrike] attack per turn.

### Level 5: Spellsight

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you can awaken your senses to the presence of magic within 30 feet as if you had cast [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic]. While this sense is active, you can touch an object and gain knowledge as if you had cast [:spell-lv1: Identify]. This special sense requires your Concentration, and it lasts for 1 minute.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 6: Ethereal Jaunt

You can focus residual power from spells to slip through the Ethereal Plane. On your turn, immediately before or after you cast a Magus spell or [Spellstrike], you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet.

The range of this feature is 10 feet, plus an extra 10 feet for each level of the spell slot you expended (maximum 60 feet).

### Level 9: Spellsunder

You can use [Spellstrike] to cut down hostile spells. When you see a creature cast a spell that will affect you, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to expend a spell slot and use an Arcane Armoury weapon to attack the spell as it takes effect.

If the spell was cast at a level equal to the level of the spell slot you expended or lower, the spell fails and has no effect. If it was cast at a level higher than the slot you expended, make an attack roll with your weapon. If your attack roll exceeds 12 + twice the level of the spell, the spell fails and has no effect.

### Level 10: Mystical Ward

You can cast your spells in battle and avoid their most potent effects. You are immune to the effects of any Magus spell you cast, unless you wish to be affected.

### Level 11: Arcane Conservation

When you use [Spellstrike] and miss with your weapon attack, you can regain one expended spell slot. When you do so, you cannot also use Ethereal Jaunt.

The spell slot you regain with this feature must be a lower level than the slot you expended as part of your [Spellstrike].

At Level 18, you regain the same spell slot you expended.

### Level 11: Prismatic Strikes

Your weapons are infused with the arcane power you channel through them. Your attacks with Arcane Armoury weapons deal a bonus 1d8 damage on hit.

This bonus damage must be the damage type dealt by a Magus spell you know, and it can be chosen on hit.

### Level 14: Superior Spellsunder

When a creature you can see within 30 feet is targeted by a spell you can see, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it and use your Spellsunder reaction against the triggering spell.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [:option-feat-boon: Epic Boon](../../option/feat/feat-boon.md) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify.
