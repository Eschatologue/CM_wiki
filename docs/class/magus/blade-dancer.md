# Order of Blade Dancers

> *Enter a Trance of Focus and Storms of Steel*

The Magi known as Blade Dancers dedicate their lives to the art of the Blade Dance. This mystical trance allows the Magi to empty their mind of all emotion and distraction to become one their blade. Masters of this trance are deadly whirlwinds of arcane power and savage steel in battle.

Typically, Magi of this Order take on a single apprentice, teaching them, and only them, the secrets of their Order.

### Level 3: Blade Dance

Your Order's style of combat is an art. You gain proficiency in Performance, and you can use your Strength or Dexterity, in place of Charisma, when making a Performance check.

So long as you are not wearing Heavy armour or wielding a weapon with :weapon-prop-heavy: Heavy Property, you can use your Bonus Action to enter the trance known as the **Blade Dance**. This trance lasts for 1 minute, and while it is active, you gain the benefits below:

***Speed Increase.*** Your Speed increases by 10 feet.

***Bonus AC.***  You gain a +1 bonus to your Armour Class.

***Improved Damage.*** Once per turn, when you roll damage for an attack or spell, you can roll the damage dice twice and use the higher result.

***Bonus to Checks.*** You add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to all Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks

Your Blade Dance ends if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you don Heavy armour or a weapon with :weapon-prop-heavy: Heavy Property, or if you end it (no action required). 

Once you enter a Blade Dance you must complete a Short or Long Rest before you can do so again. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 1+ spell slot (no action required).
