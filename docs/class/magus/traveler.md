# Order of Travelers

> *Traverse the Flow of Time*

Practitioners of what many consider a forbidden school of magic, Magi of the Order of Travelers augment their skills with Chronomancy magic, the magic of time. As they grow in their understanding of these secret magic, Travelers become increasingly detached from their place in time, and turning to become strange wanderers who safeguard the flow of time.

Legends speak of Travelers so skillful in their use of time magic who can conjure future versions of themselves to aid in combat and offer cryptic knowledge from the future. How will your Traveler Magus safeguard the flow of time?

### Level 3: Traveler Spell

When you reach a Magus level specified in the Traveler Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Traveler's Spell

| Magus Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | *Expeditious Retreat, Featherfall* |
| 5 | *Hold Person, Misty Step* |
| 9 | *Haste, Slow* |
| 13 | *Banishment, Dimension Door* |
| 17 | *Hold Monster, Modify Memory* |

### Level 3: Temporal Shift

You can alter the passage of time to undo any mistakes and missteps you may make. Whenever you fail a D20 Test, you can take a Reaction to re-roll your d20. You must use this new result.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all of your expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses of this feature remaining, you can expend a level 1+ spell slot to use this feature again.

### Level 3: Visions of the Past

You have learned to see echoes of past events in the present. You gain proficiency in History, and whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check while in the location where the subject of your Intelligence (History) check took place, you can add double your proficiency bonus to your roll.

### Level 7: Chronological Drift

Your use of time magic has caused your physical form to be detached from the normal flow of time. Your age cannot be changed by spells or magical effects, and for every 10 years that pass, your physical body only ages 1 year.

At level 15, you only age 1 year for every 100 years that pass, and at level 20, your body stops aging completely.

### Level 7: Greater Shift

Your knowledge of Chronomancy magic allows you to adjust the effects of time for the creatures around you. You can use Temporal Shift whenever a creature that you can see within 30 feet fails an ability check, misses an attack roll, or fails a saving throw. It must use the new result of its d20 roll.

Also, at the beginning of each round of initiative in combat, so long as you are not incapacitated or surprised, you can use your reaction to roll initiative again, using the new result.

### Level 15: Conjure Self

You have become so adept at the manipulation of time that you can conjure versions of yourself from the future to aid you. As a Magic action, you can expend a level 3+ spell slot to conjure a version of yourself from the future.

Your Future Self shares your initiative in combat and acts immediately after you. They act independently and will aid you to the best of their abilities. Your Future Self has a total number of hit points equal to your maximum hit points and they use your ability scores. They share features from your race, class, and other sources, including independent uses of Temporal Shift. However, you share your spell slots.

You can ask your Future Self one question concerning the future, and they answer you using the guidelines provided in the commune spell. Their knowledge is limited to things that you may know in the future as determined by the DM.

The time your Future Self remains depends on the spell slot you expended: level 3 (1 minute), level 4 (1 hour), or level 5 (8 hours). They return to their time at the end of the duration, or sooner if they are reduced to 0 hit points.

There can only ever be one version of your Future Self in your current time at once. Conjuring a second Future Self causes any others to instantly return to their time.

### Level 20: Untethered Traveler

Your use of Chronomancy has caused you to become adrift in the flow of time, seeing and experiencing it radically different from those around you. As a Magic action, you can cast a modified version of the *Time Stop* spell where you and your Future Self can both act, but you each only get one additional turn.

Once you use this feature you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast this modified version of *Time Stop* again. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
