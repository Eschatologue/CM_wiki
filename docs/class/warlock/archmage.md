# The Archmage Patron

> *Unearth the secret of the Arcana*

Your pact is forged with the lingering essence of a long-dead Archmageâ€”one who sacrificed everything in the pursuit of ultimate mastery over the Weave. Though their physical form has faded, their consciousness remains trapped within the currents of magic, sentient enough to seek an ally to complete their unfinished research. 

By striking this pact, you become the vessel for their arcane knowledge, gaining access to secrets of immense power, while also serving their obsessive desire to manipulate and reshape the very fabric of magic itself.

### Level 3: Book of the Archmage**

Your patron bestows upon you an ancient tome brimming with arcane knowledge. You gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Pact of the Tome](../../option/class-options/warlock-invocations/phb24.md#pact-of-the-tome) Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocations you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it.  

Additionally, your **Book of Shadows** serves as a repository of magical secrets, allowing you to inscribe additional spells beyond those normally known to a Warlock.  

#### Archmage's Study

At certain Warlock levels, you can inscribe additional **Wizard spells** into your **Book of Shadows**, as shown in the **Archmage's Study** table. These spells must be from the Wizard spell list and follow the level restrictions listed.  

| Warlock Level | Wizard Spells | Maximum Spell Level |  
|:-:|---|---|  
| 3 | +2 Wizard spells | Level 1 |  
| 5 | +2 Wizard spells | Level 2 |  
| 7 | +2 Wizard spells | Level 3 |  
| 9 | +2 Wizard spells | Level 4 |  
| 11 | +2 Wizard spells | Level 5 |  

You can only cast them while your **Book of Shadows** is in your possession. 

If you lose your **Book of Shadows**, you can perform a **1-hour ritual** to restore it, but you must spend **500 SP per spell level** to recreate any inscribed Wizard spells.  

### Level 3: Arcane Apprentice

When you make your pact with the Archmage, you gain the following benefits:

**Knowledge of the Weave**{ .inl } Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion. You can use your Charisma instead of Intelligence for ability checks with the chosen skill.

**Bonus Cantrip**{ .inl } You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list.

### Level 6: Astral Slip

You can draw on the arcane power of your patron to shield yourself from harm. When a creature you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see, causing the attack to miss.

Once you use this **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to evade an attack, you must finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest** before you can use it again.

### Level 6: Arcane Savant

Your patron grants you enhanced insight into the theories of arcane magic. You gain the following benefits:

**Rapid Preparation**{ .inl } Each time you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest** you can replace one Warlock spell you know of with another Warlock spell of your choice.

**Expanded Spell List**{ .inl } Each time you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one Warlock spell you know of with one spell from the Wizard spell list.

### Level 10: Magical Ward

Your understanding of the arcane allows you to resist magical effects, giving you the following benefit:

**Resistance**{ .inl } You gain Resistance to :dmg-force: Force damage.

**Change Save**{ .inl } WWhen you are forced to make a saving throw to resist a magical effect or a spell, you can make a Charisma saving throw instead of the normal save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 14: Improved Arcanum

When you choose a spell for your Mystic Arcanum, you can select a spell from the Wizard spell list instead of the Warlock spell list. This choice applies when you first select the Mystic Arcanum spell and when you replace it at later level
