# The Archmage Patron

> *Unearth the secret of the Arcana*

Your pact is forged with the lingering essence of a long-dead Archmage—one who sacrificed everything in the pursuit of ultimate mastery over the Weave. Though their physical form has faded, their consciousness remains trapped within the currents of magic, sentient enough to seek an ally to complete their unfinished research. 

By striking this pact, you become the vessel for their arcane knowledge, gaining access to secrets of immense power, while also serving their obsessive desire to manipulate and reshape the very fabric of magic itself.

### Level 3: Tome of the Archmage

Your patron bestows upon you an ancient tome brimming with arcane knowledge. You gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Pact of the Tome] Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocations you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it.  

Additionally, your Book of Shadows functions as a repository of arcane spells, allowing you greater flexibility in preparing magic.

#### Cantrips

When choosing your Warlock cantrip, you can now choose from both the Warlock and Wizard spell list. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock or Wizard cantrip of your choice.

#### Expanded Book of Shadows

Your **Book of Shadows** ^^replaces^^ your Warlock spell list and function as your personal spellbook. 

Choose **six** of level 1 or level 2 spells from the Wizard or Warlock spell list. These spells appear in your **Book of Shadows** and function as your new spell list.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells you can cast from your [Expanded Book of Shadow](#expanded-book-of-shadows) instead of the Warlock spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your **Book of Shadows**.

#### Learning Spells 

Whenever you gain a Warlock level after 3, add **two** spells from Warlock or Wizard spell list of your choice to your **Book of Shadows**. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Warlock Features table.

### Level 6: Arcane Reconstitution

When you take damage from a spell, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to regain one expended Pact Magic spell slot.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 10: Magical Ward

Your understanding of the arcane allows you to resist magical effects. When you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to add your Charisma modifier to the roll.

### Level 14: Improved Arcanum

When you choose a spell for your Mystic Arcanum, you can select a spell from the Wizard spell list instead of the Warlock spell list. This choice applies when you first select the Mystic Arcanum spell and when you replace it at later level. You still follow all other rules.
