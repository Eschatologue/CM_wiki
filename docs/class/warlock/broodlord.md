# The Broodlord Patron

You have been bestowed great powers by an ancient beast. You might make a deal with such a terrifying creature, such as: A Fate Weaver; Adragzzar, the Scorpion King; Sephira of the Feather Court; The Rat Mother, Plaguise; An extraterrestrial creature. Or other powerful creatures that you might have encountered. Your patron's goal is simple, to preserve their brood and expand. And your path is a journey to stop a great threat from destroying their broods.

### Level 3: Broodlord Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Broodlord Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv2: Blindness/Deafness], [:spell-lv2: Ray of Sickness], [:spell-lv1: Sleep], [:spell-lv1: Web] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Slow], [:spell-lv3: Stinking Cloud] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Dominate Beast], [:spell-lv4: Phantasmal Killer] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Cloudkill], [:spell-lv5: Dominate Person] |

### Level 3: Gathering Swarm

As an :rsc-a: **Action**, choose an area you can see within 60 feet, your patron's brood gathers in the area in a 10-foot cube. You can move the swarm up to 30 feet during your turn (no action required). Whenever the Brood Swarm moves within a creature's space you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Brood Swarm's space or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d10 :dmg-poison: Poison damage or takes only half damage on a successful save. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

This feature lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required). you can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 6: Venomous Gift

Your patron's lethal poison courses through your magic. When you cast a spell that deals :dmg-poison: Poison damage, it ignores :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-poison: Poison damage and you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell against one of its targets

Additionally, You have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-poison: Poison damage and you have :dmg-imm: Immunity to the Poisoned condition.

### Level 10: Protect the Hive

You can command your swarm to protect you in dire situations. When you are the target of an attack or subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, you can expend one use of your *Gathering Swarm* feature to give yourself the benefit of half-cover until the start of your next turn.

Whenever you roll Initiative and have no uses of *Gathering Swarm* left, you regain one expended use of it.

### Level 14: Brooding Transformation

You are always under the effect of the *Spider Climb* spell. As a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, You can transform parts of your body to become a large horrifying creature that resembles your patron that lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early (No action required). While in this form, you gain the following benefits:

***Monstrous Form.*** You gain a bonus +2 to your AC and your size increases by one category. Your Strength and Dexterity score is equal to your Charisma score. You are also considered to be a Monstrosity for the purpose of gameplay mechanics and magical effects.

***Natural Weapon.*** You have natural weapons such as talons or stingers. As a Magic Action, You make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 :dmg-poison: Poison damage. After using this action, you can attack again with your Natural Weapon as a Bonus Action this turn.

***Writhing Tide.*** When you transform or use the *Protect the Hive* feature, you can gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.
