# The Hexblade Patron

> *Strike Foes with Powers of Shadow*

You have forged a pact with a mysterious force bound to sentient weapons of eldritch power. These weapons, rumoured to be forged from shadow and infused with an enigmatic will, have appeared throughout history, scattered across the planes. The entity behind them grants power to those who enter its service, shaping warlocks who wield both steel and sorcery.

### Level 3: Hexblade Spells

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Hexblade Spells

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Shield], [:spell-lv1: Wrathful Smite], [:spell-lv2: Blur] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Blink], [:spell-lv3: Elemental Weapon] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Phantasmal Killer], [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster], [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold] |

### Level 3: Hex Warrior

You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain the following benefit.

**Proficiencies**{ .inl } You gain Armour Training with Medium Armour and Shields.

**Bind Weapon**{ .inl } You gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Pact of the Blade](../../option/class-options/warlock-invocations/phb24.md#pact-of-the-blade) Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocation you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it.  
&emsp; When you hit a creature with a Pact Weapon, you can curse your target with [Hexblade's Curse](#level-3-hexblades-curse) (no action required) as part of the attack, applying its damage bonus and other benefits (if any) to the damage roll.

### Level 3: Hexblade's Curse

You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on your enemies. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, choose one creature you can see within **30 feet** of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or when you have the ^^Incapacitated^^ condition. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

**Improved Critical**{ .inl } The number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking the a cursed target is reduced by 1.

**Maim**{ .inl} Once per turn, when you hit the cursed target with an attack, you can deal additional damage equal to half of your Warlock level (rounded down).

**Reaper**{ .inl } If the cursed target dies, you regain **:trt-hp: Hit Points** equal to your Warlock level.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**. Alternatively, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to regain one use of it (no action required).

### Level 6: Accursed Spectre

Raise an Accursed Spectre from the soul of a fallen cursed target to fight by your side.

When you slay a creature, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as an Accursed Specter, as detailed below. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. If you don’t issue any, it takes the **:rsc-a: Dodge**{ .rsc } action and uses its move to avoid danger.

The Accursed Specter remains in your service until the end of your next **:rest-long: Long Rest**, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind an Accursed Specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 10: Armor of Hexes

Your hex grows more powerful. If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.

### Level 14: Master of Hexes

Your Hexblade’s Curse becomes more debilitating. When you curse a creature with your Hexblade’s Curse, you gain the following benefits:

**Impending Doom**{ .inl }  The cursed target has its Speed reduced by 15 feet.

**Relentless Curse**{ .inl } You can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the cursed target. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target.
