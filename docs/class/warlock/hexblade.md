# The Hexblade Patron

> *Strike Foes with Powers of Shadow*

You have forged a pact with a mysterious force bound to sentient weapons of eldritch power. These weapons, rumoured to be forged from shadow and infused with an enigmatic will, have appeared throughout history, scattered across the planes. The entity behind them grants power to those who enter its service, shaping warlocks who wield both steel and sorcery.

### Level 3: Hexblade Spells

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Hexblade Spells

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Shield], [:spell-lv1: Hex], [:spell-lv1: Wrathful Smite], [:spell-lv2: Blur] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Blink], [:spell-lv3: Elemental Weapon] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Phantasmal Killer], [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster], [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold] |

### Level 3: Hex Warrior

You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain the following benefit

**Proficiencies**{ .inl } You gain Armour Training with Medium Armour and Shields.

**Bind Weapon**{ .inl } You learn how to bind a weapon to you. You gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Pact of the Blade](../../option/class-options/warlock-invocations/phb24.md#pact-of-the-blade) Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocation you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it.

### Level 3: Hexblade's Curse

You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on your enemies. 

Whenever you cast [:spell-lv1: Hex], it does not require **:spell-conc: Concentration**. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits against the spell's target:

**Improved Critical**{ .inl } The number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking the target is reduced by 1.

**Reaper**{ .inl } When you deal **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } damage to the target, you can absorb its life essence, giving you **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to half the **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } damage dealt. This has no effect on Constructs or Undead.

You can also cast [:spell-lv1: Hex] as a level 1 spell once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**.

### Level 6: Accursed Spectre

Raise an Accursed Spectre from the soul of a fallen cursed target to fight by your side.

When you slay a creature, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as an Accursed Specter, as detailed below. In combat, it shares your Initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands. If you donâ€™t issue any, it takes the **:rsc-a: Dodge**{ .rsc } action and uses its move to avoid danger.

The Accursed Specter remains in your service until the end of your next **:rest-long: Long Rest**, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife. Once you bind an Accursed Specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
