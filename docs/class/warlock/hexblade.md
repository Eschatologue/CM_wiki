# The Hexblade Patron

> *Strike Foes with Powers of Shadow*

You have forged a pact with a mysterious force bound to sentient weapons of eldritch power. These weapons, rumoured to be forged from shadow and infused with an enigmatic will, have appeared throughout history, scattered across the planes. The entity behind them grants power to those who enter its service, shaping warlocks who wield both steel and sorcery.

### Level 3: Hexblade Spells

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Hexblade Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Hexblade Spells

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Shield], [:spell-lv1: Wrathful Smite], [:spell-lv2: Darkness], [:spell-lv2: Blur] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Blink], [:spell-lv3: Elemental Weapon] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Phantasmal Killer], [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster], [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold] |

### Level 3: Hexblade's Curse

You gain the ability to place a baleful curse on your enemies. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}, choose one creature you can see within **30 feet** of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or when you have the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:

**Improved Critical**{.inl} The number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking the a cursed target is reduced by 1.

**Maim**{ .inl} When you hit the cursed target with an attack, your Charisma modifier is added twice to the damage roll instead of once.

**Reaper**{.inl} If the cursed target dies, you regain **:trt-hp: Hit Points** equal to your Warlock level.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**. Alternatively, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to regain one use of it (no action required).

### Level 3: Hex Warrior

You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain the following benefit.

**Proficiencies**{.inl} You gain Armour Training with Medium Armour and Shields.

**Bind Weapon**{.inl} You gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Pact of the Blade](../../option/class-options/warlock-invocations/phb24.md#pact-of-the-blade) Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocation you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it.  
&emsp; When you hit a creature with a Pact Weapon, you can curse your target with [Hexblade's Curse] (no action required) as part of the attack, applying its damage bonus and other benefits (if any) to the damage roll.

### Level 6: Spectral Weapon

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}, you can materialise a *Spectral Weapon*, which is an ethereal, floating copy of your Pact Weapon within **30 feet** of you. This *Spectral Weapon* is considered an **Object** (**:material-shield: AC 10**, **:trt-hp: 1 HP**). On your turn, you can command the *Spectral Weapon* to move up to **20 feet**.

When you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{.rsc} action using your Pact Weapon, you can make it originate from your space or the *Spectral Weapon* space. You make this choice for each attack. When a creature that you can see within the reach of the *Spectral Weapon* moves away from it, you make an **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attack**{.rsc} against that creature as if you were in the *Spectral Weapon's* space.

The *Spectral Weapon* lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it (no action required), until you materialise another *Spectral Weapon*, or until you have the **Incapacitated**{.cond} condition.

### Level 10: Prodigy of Hexes

Your hex grows more powerful, giving you the follwing benefits: 

**Awaken Weapon**{.inl} You can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} to make one attack using your Pact Weapon, originating from the the *Spectral Weapon's* position.

**Hex Armour**{.inl} If the target cursed by your [Hexblade's Curse] hits you or your *Spectral Weapon* with an attack roll, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{.rsc} to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses, regardless of its roll.

### Level 14: Master of Hexes

Your Hexbladeâ€™s Curse becomes more debilitating. When you curse a creature with your [Hexblade's Curse], you gain the following benefits:

**Impending Doom**{.inl} The cursed target has its **:rsc-spd: Speed**{.mv} reduced by **15 feet**.

**Relentless Curse**{.inl} When you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{.rsc} action using your Pact Weapon, you can Teleport yourself or your *Spectral Weapon* up to **30 feet** to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a cursed target that you can see as part of the attack.
