# The Lóng Dragon Patron

> *Unleash the power of an Ancient Dragon*

Your pact is bound to a Lóng dragon, a being of celestial wisdom and arcane power, guiding those they deem worthy along the path of enlightenment—or peril. Your patron’s motives are vast, inscrutable, and beyond mortal comprehension, and whether you are a chosen pupil or a mere piece in a greater design is known only to them.

### Level 3: Scion of Permanence

Your patron grants you gifts to aid your journey, bestowing the following benefit:

#### Draconic Spark { .hide }

**Draconic Spark**{ .inl } Your patron imbues you with a fragment of its elemental power. Choose one of the following damage types: **:dmg-acid: Acid**{ .dmg-acid }, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{ .dmg-cold }, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire }, **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn }. You can change this choice when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. This choice will affects multiple features in this subclass.
{ .indt }

**Draconic Transmutation**{ .inl } Whenever you cast a Warlock spell or Cantrip, you can change its damage type to that of your [Draconic Spark].
{ .indt }

**Draconic Language**{ .inl } Your patron imbues you with its wisdom. You know the *Draconic* language.
{ .indt }

### Level 3: Draconic Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Bless], [:spell-lv1: Command], [:spell-lv2: Scorching Ray], [:spell-lv2: Gust of Wind] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Call Lightning], [:spell-lv3: Fear] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Control Water], [:spell-lv4: Dominate Beast] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Commune], [:spell-lv5: Immolation] |

### Level 3: Dragon’s Exhalation

As a **:rsc-a: Magic** action, you can unleash a blast of elemental energy in a **15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone** or a **5 by 30-foot :aoe-line: Line** (choose the shape each time), originating from you. Creature in that area makes a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{ .rsc }, taking damage equals to `1d8 plus your Charisma modifier` on a failed save. Damage dealt by this action is always the [Draconic Spark] damage. 

You can make **two** Dragon’s Exhalation as part of the same action when you reach **level 6**, **three** Dragon’s Exhalation at **level 10**, and finally **four** Dragon’s Exhalation at **level 14**.

### Level 6: Draconic Insight

You gain increased comprehension of the way of your Dragon patron, whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Charisma check even if it normally uses a different ability: Arcana, History, Insight, or Perception.

You also gain **:dmg-res: Resistance** to the damage type of your [Draconic Spark]. In addition, your whenever you deal your [Draconic Spark] damage using Dragon’s Exhalation or from casting Warlock spells, it ignores **:dmg-res: Resistance**.

## Level 10: Far-Reaching Exhalation

When you make a Dragon’s Exhalation, you can choose for it to be a **30-foot :aoe-cone: Cone** or a **5 by 60-foot :aoe-line: Line**.

### Level 10: Flowing Spirit

You gain **:dmg-imm: Immunity** to the damage type of your [Draconic Spark]. You also have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on **:d20-save: Saving Throws**{ .em } you make to avoid or end the ^^Charmed^^ or ^^Frightened^^ condition. 

Moreover, you gain the [:class-phb24-warlock: Curse of Permanence](../../option/class-options/warlock-invocations/hb.md#curse-of-permanence) Invocation. This Invocation doesn't count against the number of Invocation you can have and can't be replaced. Choose a different Invocation if you already have it. 

### Level 14: Dragon’s Tempest

Whenever you make a Dragon’s Exhalation, you can expend one of your Pact Magic spell slots to empower one of them. On a failed save, targets take additional Draconic Spark damage equal to 1d8 per level of your Pact Magic spell slot, and they take half as much damage on a successful saving throw. 

### Level 14: Soaring Winds 

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can manifest (or dismiss) the elements to carry you aloft. This takes the form of spectral wings, swirling winds, flowing water, or another expression of your patron’s power might be. While manifested, you gain a **Fly Speed** equal to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em }.
