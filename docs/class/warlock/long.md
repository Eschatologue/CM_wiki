# The Lóng Patron

> *catchphrase*

Your pact is bound to a Lóng dragon, a being of celestial wisdom and arcane power. These dragons do not covet gold but knowledge, guiding those they deem worthy along the path of enlightenment—or peril. Your patron’s motives are vast, inscrutable, and beyond mortal comprehension, and whether you are a chosen pupil or a mere piece in a greater design is known only to them.

### Level 3: Scions of a Wise One

Your patron grants you gifts to aid your journey, bestowing the following benefit:

###### Draconic Spark

Your patron imbues you with a fragment of its elemental power. Choose one of the following damage types: **:dmg-acid: Acid**{ .dmg-acid }, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{ .dmg-cold }, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire }, **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn }. This choice affects multiple features in this subclass. You can change this choice when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**

You gain **:dmg-res: Resistance** to the damage type of your Draconic Spark, and whenever you cast a Warlock spell or Cantrip, you can change its damage type to that of your Draconic Spark.

###### Draconic Wisdom

Your patron imbues you with its wisdom. You know the Draconic language.

### Level 3: Draconic Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
