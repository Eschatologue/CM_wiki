# The Lóng Dragon Patron

> *catchphrase*

Your pact is bound to a Lóng dragon, a being of celestial wisdom and arcane power. These dragons do not covet gold but knowledge, guiding those they deem worthy along the path of enlightenment—or peril. Your patron’s motives are vast, inscrutable, and beyond mortal comprehension, and whether you are a chosen pupil or a mere piece in a greater design is known only to them.

### Level 3: Scions of a Wise One

Your patron grants you gifts to aid your journey, bestowing the following benefit:

#### Draconic Spark { .hide }

**Draconic Spark**{ .inl } Your patron imbues you with a fragment of its elemental power. Choose one of the following damage types: **:dmg-acid: Acid**{ .dmg-acid }, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{ .dmg-cold }, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire }, **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn }. This choice affects multiple features in this subclass. You can change this choice when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**  
&emsp;Moreover, you gain **:dmg-res: Resistance** to the damage type of your Draconic Spark, and whenever you cast a Warlock spell or Cantrip, you can change its damage type to that of your Draconic Spark.

**Draconic Language**{ .inl } Your patron imbues you with its wisdom. You know the *Draconic* language.

### Level 3: Draconic Spells

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Bless], [:spell-lv1: Command], [:spell-lv2: Scorching Ray], [:spell-lv2: Gust of Wind] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Call Lightning], [:spell-lv3: Fear] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Dominate Beast], [:spell-lv4: Wall of Fire] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Yolande's Regal Presence], [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold] |

### Level 3: Eldritch Breath

As a **:rsc-a: Magic** action, you can exhale a blast of elemental energy from your mouth in a **15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone** or a **5 by 30 ft. :aoe-line: Line** (choose the shape each time), originating from you. Creature in that area makes a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{ .rsc }, taking damage equals to `1d8 plus your Charisma modifier` on a failed save. Damage dealt by this action is always the [Draconic Spark] damage. 

You can make **two** Eldritch Breath as part of the same action when you reach level 6, **three** Eldritch Breath at level 10, and finally **four** Eldritch Breath at level 14.

### Level 6: Draconic Attunement

You gain increased comprehension of the way of your Dragon patron, giving you the following benefits:

**Draconic Wisdom**{ .inl } Whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Charisma check even if it normally uses a different ability: Arcana, History, Insight, or Perception.

**Potent Blast**{ .inl } Whenever you deal your [Draconic Spark] damage type with a Warlock spell or with your Eldritch Breath you can treat a roll of 1 or 2 on any of the damage dice as a 3.

### Level 10: Draconic Presence

You are immune to the Charmed and Frightened condition. 

Moreover, You also learn the [Lesson of the First One] Invocation. It does not count against your number of Invocations Known, and it cannot be replaced. If you already know this Invocation, you gain another Eldritch Invocation of your choice..
