# Otherworldly Patron: Fiend

Your pact draws on the power of the Lower Planes—the homes of demons, devils, yugoloths, and other Fiends. When you choose this subclass, you might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, or Baphomet; an archdevil such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, or Glasya; a pit fiend or balor that is especially mighty; or an ultroloth or some other lord of the yugoloths. Alternatively, you might call on a varied array of Fiends without binding yourself to the service of one. 

In any case, your patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path will be defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

## Patron Spells – Level 3

The magic of your otherworldly patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | Burning Hands, Command, Scorching Ray, Suggestion |
| 5 | Fireball, Stinking Cloud |
| 7 | Fire Shield, Wall of Fire |
| 9 | Geas, Insect Plague |

## Dark One’S Blessing – Level 3

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit Points.

## Dark One’S Own Luck – Level 6

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Fiendish Resilience – Level 10

Channeling the preternatural resilience of Fiends, you can choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest. You gain Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

## Hurl Through Hell – Level 14

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the Incapacitated condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a level 5 spell slot when you use it again. You can use this feature only once per turn.
