# Artificer: Armourer

*Don Magical and Customisable Armour*

An artificer who specializes as an Armourer modifies armour to function almost like a second skin. The armour is enhanced to hone the Artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The Artificer bonds with this armour, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.

### Level 3: Tools of the Trade
You have Training with Heavy Armour and proficiency with Smith’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan’s Tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Smith’s Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Strength.

### Level 3: Armourer Spells
Your tinkering with Arcane Armour ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Armourer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Armourer Spells

| Artificer Level | Armourer Spells |
|:-:|:-:|
| 3rd | Magic Missile, Thunderwave |
| 5th | Mirror Image, Shatter |
| 9th | Hypnotic Pattern, Lightning Bolt |
| 13th | Fire Shield, Greater Invisibility |
| 17th | Passwall, Wall of Force |

### Level 3: Arcane Armour

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armour a conduit for your magic. As a Magic action, you can turn a suit of armour you are wearing into Arcane Armour, provided you have Smith’s Tools in hand. The armour continues to be Arcane Armour until you don another suit of armour or you die.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armour:

***Self Supporting.*** If the armour normally has a Strength requirement, the Arcane Armour lacks this requirement for you.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use the Arcane Armour as a spellcasting focus for your Artificer spells.

***Second Skin.*** The armour attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a Bonus Action. The armour replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.

***Quick Don/Doff.*** You can doff or don the armour as an action.

### Level 3: Armour Model

You can customize your Arcane Armour. When you do so, choose one of the following armour models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

***Special Weapon.*** Each model includes a special weapon. You can only use the Mastery property of the weapon if another feature allows you to use it, as normal.

***Changing the Model.*** You can change the armour’s model whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest, provided you have Smith’s Tools in hand.

**Guardian**  
You design your armour to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:

- ***Thunder Gauntlets.*** Each of the armour’s gauntlets counts as a Simple Melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 Thunder damage on a hit. The gauntlets have the Push Mastery property.

- ***Distracting Pulse.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armour magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.

- ***Defensive Field.*** As a Bonus Action, you can expend one Ingenuity Point to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your level in this class. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you doff the armour.

**Infiltrator**  
You customize your armour for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:

- ***Lightning Launcher***. A gemlike node appears on one of your armoured fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a Simple Ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 Lightning damage on a hit. The Lightning Launcher has the Vex Mastery property.

- ***Lightning Arc.*** Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can deal an extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target, as your armour arcs electricity between itself and the target.

- ***Powered Steps.*** As a Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Ingenuity Point to take the Disengage action. When you do so, your Speed is increased by 15 feet until the end of your turn.

- ***Dampening Field.*** You have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armour normally imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.

### Level 6: Armour Overcharge

As a Bonus Action while wearing your Arcane Armour, you can expend one Ingenuity Point to flood it with magical energy. You gain the following benefit depending on your armour model for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until you doff the armour.

***Guardian.*** You can make an attack with your Thunder Gauntlets as a Bonus Action, including as part of the Bonus Action you use to activate this feature.

***Infiltrator.*** You gain a Fly Speed of 30 feet. When you activate your Powered Steps, this Speed increases by 15 feet until the end of your turn.

### Level 9: Armour Modifications

You learn how to use your Infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armour.

***Infusing the Armour.*** Your Arcane Armour now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Item feature: armour (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armour’s special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your Infusions, and the Infusions transfer over if you change your armour’s model with the Armour Model feature.

***Free Infusions.*** The maximum number of items you can Infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armour.

### Level 15: Perfected Armour

Your Arcane Armour gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

***Guardian.*** When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to expend one Ingenuity Point and magically force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee attack against it as part of this Reaction.

***Infiltrator.*** When you deal damage to a creature with an attack, or one fails a saving throw against one of your spells, you can expend one Ingenuity Point to cause your Lightning Launcher to light up that creature, which glimmers in a 5-foot radius until the start of your next turn. During this time, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, once per turn when it is targeted with an attack, that attack has Advantage, and if it hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 Lightning Damage.
