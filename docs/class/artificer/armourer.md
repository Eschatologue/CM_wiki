# Artificer: Armourer

***An artificer who specializes as an Armourer modifies armour to function almost like a second skin. The armour is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armour, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.***

## Tools of the Trade

When you adopt this specialization at **3rd level**, you gain proficiency with heavy armour. You also gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

## Level 3: Armourer Spells

You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armourer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Armourer Spells |
|:-:|:-:|
| 3rd | [Magic Missile], [Thunderwave] |
| 5th | [Mirror Image], [Shatter] |
| 9th | [Hypnotic Pattern], [Lightning Bolt] |
| 13th | [Fire Shield], [Greater Invisibility] |
| 17th | [Passwall], [Wall of Force] |

## Level 3: Arcane Armour

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armour a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armour you are wearing into Arcane Armour, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armour:

- If the armour normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armour lacks this requirement for you.
- You can use the arcane armour as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
- The armour attaches to you and canâ€™t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armour replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a body part it is replacing.
- You can doff or don the armour as an action.

The armour continues to be Arcane Armour until you don another suit of armour or you die.

## Level 3: Armour Model

You can customize your Arcane Armour. When you do so, choose one of the following armour models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armour's model whenever you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest, provided you have smith's tools in hand.

### Guardian

You design your armour to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:

- **Thunder Gauntlets.** Each of the armour's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armour magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.
- **Defensive Field.** As a bonus action, you can gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary Hit Points you already have. You lose these temporary Hit Points if you doff the armour. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Infiltrator

You customize your armour for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:

- **Lightning Launcher.** A gemlike node appears on one of your armoured fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.
- **Powered Steps.** Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
- **Dampening Field.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armour normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.

## Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Level 9: Armour Modifications

You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armour. 

That armour now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Items feature: armour (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armour's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armour's model with the Armour Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armour.

## Level 15: Perfected Armour

our Arcane Armour gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

**Guardian.** When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

**Infiltrator.** Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.
