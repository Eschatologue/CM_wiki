# Armourer

> *Don Magical and Customisable Armour*

An artificer who specializes as an Armourer modifies armour to function almost like a second skin. The armour is enhanced to hone the Artificer's magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The Artificer bonds with this armour, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.

### Level 3: Tools of the Trade

You have Training with Heavy Armour and proficiency with Smith's Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan's Tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Smith's Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Strength.

### Level 3: Armourer Spells
Your tinkering with Arcane Armour ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Armourer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Armourer Spells

| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:-:|:--|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Magic Missile], [:spell-lv1: Thunderwave] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Mirror Image], [:spell-lv2: Shatter] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Hypnotic Pattern], [:spell-lv3: Lightning Bolt] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield], [:spell-lv4: Greater Invisibility] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Passwall], [:spell-lv5: Wall of Force] |

### Level 3: Arcane Armour

Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armour a conduit for your magic. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you can turn a suit of armour you are wearing into Arcane Armour, provided you have Smith's Tools in hand. The armour continues to be Arcane Armour until you don another suit of armour or you die.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armour:

**Self Supporting**{ .inl } If the armour normally has a Strength requirement, you can use Intelligence to fufill the requirement.

**Spellcasting Focus**{ .inl }You can use the Arcane Armour as a spellcasting focus for your Artificer spells.

**Second Skin**{ .inl } The armour attaches to you and can't be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body. You can retract or deploy the helmet as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }. The armour replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.

**Quick Don/Doff**{ .inl } You can doff or don the armour as an :rsc-a: Utilise action.

### Level 3: Armour Model

You can customize your Arcane Armour. When you do so, choose one of the following armour models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

**Special Weapon**{ .inl } Each model includes a special weapon. You can only use the Mastery property of the weapon if another feature allows you to use it, as normal.

**Changing the Model**{ .inl } You can change the armour's model whenever you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, provided you have Smith's Tools in hand.

#### Guardian

You design your armour to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:

**Thunder Gauntlets**{ .inl } Each of the armour's gauntlets has the following trait:

:   **Weapon Category:** Simple Melee  
    **Damage on a Hit:** **1d8 :dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } (2d8 at level 15) plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll

**Distracting Pulse**{ .inl } When you hit a creature with a melee attack, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armour magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.

**Defensive Field**{ .inl } While you are Bloodied, you can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Artificer level. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you doff the armour.

#### Infiltrator

You customize your armour for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:

**Lightning Launcher**{ .inl } A gemlike node appears on one of your armoured gauntlet. It has the following trait:

:   **Weapon Category:** Simple Ranged  
    **Damage on a Hit:** **1d6 :dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } (2d6 at level 15) plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll  
    **Properties:** Ranged (90/270)

**Lightning Arc**{ .inl } Once per turn when you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can deal an extra **1d6 :dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } damage to that target, as your armour arcs electricity between itself and the target.

**Dampening Field**{ .inl } You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 }  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armour normally imposes **:d20-disadv: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on such checks, it cancel each other as normal.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your Artificer cantrip that has the casting time of an action in place of those attack.

### Level 9: Armour Modifications

You learn how to use your Infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armour.

**Infusing the Armour**{ .inl } Your Arcane Armour now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Item feature: armour (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armour's special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your Infusions, and the Infusions transfer over if you change your armour's model with the Armour Model feature.

**Free Infusions**{ .inl } The maximum number of items you can Infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armour.

### Level 15: Perfected Armour

Your Arcane Armour gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

#### Guardian

When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to magically force it to make a :d20-save: Strength saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Infiltrator

Any creature that takes **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has **:d20-disadv: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 }, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra **1d6 :dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } damage.
