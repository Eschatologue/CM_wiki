{ .quote .align-center }

Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, Artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an Artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armour, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of Artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.

### Level 1: Arcane Tinkerer 

Your knack for tinkering has taught you to store minor magical effects in mundane objects. You know the [:spell-lv0: Magical Tinkering] cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know.

Further, whenever you make an ability check with Artisan's Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, provided you are proficient with it.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, which appear in the [Artificer spell list] later in the class's description. 

You cast spells by channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells.

#### Cantrips 

You know two cantrips of your choice from the [Artificer spell list]. [:spell-lv0: Fire Bolt] and [:spell-lv0: Mending] are recommended.

Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the [Artificer spell list].

#### Spell Slots

The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1 spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. [:spell-lv1: Faerie Fire] and [:spell-lv1: Identify] are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Artificer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you may always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can replace one spell on your list with another Artificer spell for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

:abl-int: **Intelligence** is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

#### Tools Required

You produce your Artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically Thieves' Tools or some kind of Artisan's Tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M' component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 6, “Equipment,” in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at level 2, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

[Artificer spell list]:../../spells/class-specific/artificer.md

### Level 2: Infuse Item

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusions Known

When you gain this feature, pick four Artificer Infusions to learn, choosing from the "[Artificer Infusions]" section. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

??? tip "Artificer Infusions"

    Artificers have invented numerous magical infusions, extraordinary processes that rapidly create magic items. To many, Artificers seem like wonderworkers, accomplishing in hours what others need weeks to complete.

    The description of each of the following infusions details the type of item that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.

    Some infusions specify a minimum Artificer level. You can't learn such an infusion until you are at least that level.

    Unless an infusion's description says otherwise, you can't learn an infusion more than once.

#### Infusing an Item

You gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.

#### Infusions Known 

When you gain this feature, pick four Infusions to learn, choosing from the "[Artificer Infusions]" section. You learn additional Infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer Features table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Infusing an Item

After completing a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can touch a non-magical (also called mundane) object and imbue it with one of your Infusions, transforming it into a magical item. Each Infusion specifies the types of objects it can be applied to.

If the item requires attunement, you can attune to it instantly when you infuse it. Alternatively, you may attune to it later through the standard attunement process.

An Infusion remains active indefinitely but ends if:

- You die, after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).
- You replace the Infusion with another one.

At the end of a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you may infuse multiple non-magical objects, up to the limit indicated in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer Features table. Each Infusion can only be applied to one object, and no object may bear more than one Infusion at a time. If applying a new Infusion would exceed your maximum, you must choose one active Infusion to end before applying the new one.

If an Infusion ends on an object with contents (such as a Bag of Holding), its contents appear harmlessly in and around the item's location.

[Artificer Infusions]: ../../option/class-options/artificer-infusion/index.md

### Level 3: Artificer Subclass

You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Artificer level or lower.

### Level 3: The Right Tool for the Job

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with [Thieves' Tools] or [Artisan's Tools] in hand, you can magically create one set of [Artisan's Tools] in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

[Thieves' Tools]: ../../equipment/tools/other-tools.md#thieves-tools
[Artisan's Tools]: ../../equipment/tools/artisan-tools.md

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the [:option-feat-general: Ability Score Improvement](../../option/feat/feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, 16, and 19.

### Level 6: Tool Expertise

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

### Level 7: Flash of Genius

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 10: Magic Item Adept

You've achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

**Five Magic Items**{.inl} You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

**Magic Crafting**{.inl} If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Level 11: Spell-Storing Item

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1 or 2 spell from the [Artificer spell list] that requires an :rsc-a: Action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your :abl-int: Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### Level 14: Magic Item Savant

Your skill with magic items deepens:

**Five Magic Items**{.inl} You can attune to up to five magic items at once.

**Attunement Master**{.inl} You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Level 18: Magic Item Master

Your mastery over magic items reaches its zenith.

**Six Attunements**{.inl} You can attune to up to six magic items at once.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an [:option-feat-boon: Epic Boon](../../option/feat/feat-boon.md) feat or another [feat](../../option/feat/index.md) of your choice for which you qualify.

### Level 20: Soul of Artifice

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

**Armoured Soul**{.inl} You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.

**Infusion Contingency**{.inl} If you're reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed out-right, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to end one of your Infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0, and you instantly regain 30 Hit Points.
