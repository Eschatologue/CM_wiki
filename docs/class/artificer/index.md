Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.***

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

### Level 1: Magical Tinkering

You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
- The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

**Cantrips**  
You know three cantrips of your choice from the Artificer spell list.

Whenever you gain a Artificer level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Artificer spell list.

When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Artificer spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

**Spell Slots**  
The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+**  
You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Artificer spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Artificer spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells**  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**  
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**  
You can use an Artisan Tool as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. After you gain the Infuse Item feature at Level 2, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Level 2: Infuse Item

You've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

**Infusions Known**  
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

**Infusing an Item**  
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a Long Rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Level 3: Artificer Subclass

You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level or lower.

### Level 3: The Right Tool for the Job

You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a Short Rest or Long Rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement 

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Artificer levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 6: Tool Expertise

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

### Level 7: Flash of Genius

You've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 10: Magic Item Adept

You achieve a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

- You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
- If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Level 11: Spell-Storing Item

You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1 or level 2 spell from the artificer spell list takes a Magic action to cast (you needn't have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take a Magic action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it's been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### Level 14: Magic Item Savant

Your skill with magic items deepens more:

- You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- You ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Level 18: Magic Item Master

You can attune up to six magic items at once.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

### Level 20: Soul of Artifice

You develop a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

- You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
- If you're reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed out-right, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 Hit Point instead of 0.
