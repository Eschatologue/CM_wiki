Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

Masters of unlocking magic in everyday objects, artificers are supreme inventors. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled. Artificers use tools to channel arcane power, crafting magical objects. To cast a spell, an artificer could use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power on an ally's armor, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents.

### Level 1: Spellcasting

You’ve studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions. See chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Artificer spells, which appear in the Artificer spell list later in this class's description.

#### Cantrips 

You know two cantrips of your choice from the Artificer spell list. Fire Bolt and Mending are recommended.

Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Artificer spell list.

When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Artificer spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Artificer Features table.

#### Spell Slots

The Artificer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1 spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Faerie Fire and Identify are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Artificer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Artificer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Artificer, your list of prepared spells can include six Artificer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you may always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

#### Changing Your Prepared Spells

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Artificer spell for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

#### Tools Required

You produce your Artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically Thieves’ Tools or some kind of Artisan’s Tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an ‘M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 6, “Equipment,” in the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of these tools.

After you gain the Infuse Item feature at level 2, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.

### Level 1: Arcane Tinkerer

Your knack for tinkering has taught you to store minor magical effects in mundane objects. You know the *[Magical Tinkering](../../spells/description/m.md#magical-tinkering)* cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know.

Further, whenever you make an ability check with Tinker’s Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Dexterity.

### Level 1: Artificer’s Ingenuity

Your prowess with tinkering and technology has provided you with a knack for solving problems, which manifests as a pool of Ingenuity Points.

***Number of Points.*** You have a number of Ingenuity Points as shown in the Ingenuity column of the Artificer Features table, and you regain all expended points when you finish a Long Rest. When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain up to half your maximum amount (rounded down). You then cannot do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Flash of Genius.*** When you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails an ability check, you can use your Reaction to expend one Ingenuity Point and add your Intelligence modifier to the roll, potentially turning it into a success.

### Level 2: Tinkerer’s Talent

You have developed means of protecting yourself in a fight. Select one of the following two Talents:

#### Weaponsmith
 
You prefer to use equipment to protect yourself.

- ***Extra Proficiencies.*** You have proficiency with Martial weapons.

- ***Intelligent Attacks.*** When you make an attack with a magic weapon with which you have proficiency, you can choose to use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls, instead of Strength or Dexterity.

- ***Weapon Mastery.*** Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch a weapon with which you have proficiency. Until you next finish a Long Rest, you can use the Mastery property of that weapon. Starting at level 10, you can touch two weapons when you finish a Long Rest and gain their Mastery Properties, instead of one.

#### Arcanosmith

You favor focussing on your spellcasting to protect you.

- ***Extra Proficiency.*** Your devotion to learning arcane magic grants you proficiency with the Arcana skill. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain Expertise.

- ***Extra Cantrip.*** You know one extra cantrip from the Artificer spell list. You gain another extra Artificer cantrip of your choice at level 10.

- ***Spell Recovery.*** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can regain one expended spell slot of your choice. The level of the spell slot cannot exceed your highest spell slot level as shown on the Artificer Features table, even if you are a multiclassed character.

!!! Note "Flavoring Weapon Mastery"

    While a Fighter typically uses the Mastery property of a weapon through extensive training to use that weapon to its full potential, a Weaponsmith Artificer is more likely to have fitted their weapon with modifications or arcane technology to achieve the same effect. For example, they might fit a Longbow with an arcane freezing agent to produce the effects of the Slow Mastery property.

### Level 2: Infuse Item

You gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions. The magic items you create with this feature are effectively prototypes of permanent items.

#### Infusions Known

When you gain this feature, pick four Infusions to learn, choosing from the “[Artificer Infusions](../../character-creation/option/artificer-infusion.md)”. You learn additional Infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer Features table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Infusing an Item

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch a non-magical object and imbue it with one of your Infusions, turning it into a magic item. An Infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.

Your Infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the Infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The Infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the Infusion for another one.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a Long Rest; the maximum number of objects appears in parentheses in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer Features table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your Infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your Infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of Infusions, one Infusion of your choice immediately ends, and then the new Infusion applies.

If an Infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a Bag of Holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Level 3: Artificer Subclass

You gain an Artificer subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you special abilities at certain Artificer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Artificer level and lower.

### Level 3: Right Tool for the Job

You learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with Thieves’ Tools or Artisan’s Tools, you can magically create one set of Artisan’s Tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a Short or Long Rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 5: Honed Talent.

You gain a benefit depending on the Artificer’s Talent you chose at level 1:

***Weaponsmith.*** Whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can attack twice, rather than once.

***Arcanosmith.*** When you cast an Artificer spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to one of the spell’s damage rolls.

### Level 6: Tool Expertise

Whenever you make an ability check that uses your proficiency with a Tool, you have Expertise with that check.

### Level 7: Flash of Genius Improvement

You can now use your Flash of Genius Reaction on failed saving throws, as well as ability checks, following all the same rules.

### Level 10: Magic Item Adept

You have achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

***Four Attunements.*** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

***Quick Craft.*** If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Level 11: Spell Storing Item

You learn how to store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1 or 2 spell from the Artificer spell list that has an action casting time (you needn’t have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take the Magic action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must Concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### Level 13: Artisan’s Knack  

Your magical connection to equipment allows you to utilize your gear extremely swiftly when the need arises. As a Bonus Action, you can use the Utilize action for a set of tools with which you’re proficient, or the Magic action to activate a magic item

### Level 14: Magic Item Savant

Your skill with magic items has only deepened, granting you the following benefits:

***Five Attunements.*** You can attune to up to five magic items at once.

***Omnitalented.*** You ignore all class, species, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Level 17: Synergistic Infusions

Your mastery over artifice allows you to mix magics and apply your Infusions to items already harboring magic.

***Magic items.*** A magic item can bear one of your Infusions, unless it is an artifact.  

***Mundane items.*** A nonmagical item now can bear up to two of your Infusions at once. You cannot apply the same Infusion to an object multiple times.

***Numerical Bonuses.*** If both the magic item and the infusion (or both infusions) provide a bonus to attack and damage rolls, or to AC, add the bonuses together, but the combined bonus is reduced to +3 if it would otherwise exceed it.

***Attunement.*** If both the magic item and the infusion (or both infusions) require attunement, you must attune to each set of benefits separately.

### Level 18: Magic Item Master

Your mastery over magic items reaches its zenith.

***Six Attunements.*** You can attune to up to six magic items at once.

### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Spell Recall is recommended.

### Level 20: Soul of Artifice

You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

***Armored Soul.*** You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.

***Infusion Contingency.*** If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed out-right, you can use your Reaction to end one of your Infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0, and you instantly regain 30 Hit Points.
