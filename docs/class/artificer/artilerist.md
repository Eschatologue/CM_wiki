# Artilerist Specialisation

> *Blow Enemies Away with Magical Artillery*

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds. And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife.

### Level 3: Tool Proficiency
You gain proficiency with Woodcarver’s Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Woodcarver’s Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Dexterity.

### Level 3: Artillerist Spells
Your experimentation with explosive magic ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Artillerist Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Artilerist Spells
| Artificer Level | Artillerist Spells |
|:-:|:--|
| 3 | *Shield*, *Thunderwave* |
| 5 | *Scorching Ray*, *Shatter* |
| 9 | *Fireball*, *Wind Wall* |
| 13 | *Ice Storm*, *Wall of Fire* |
| 17 | *Cone of Cold*, *Wall of Force* |

### Level 3: Eldritch Cannon

You've learned how to create a magical cannon.

***Creating a Cannon.*** Using Woodcarver’s Tools or Smith’s Tools, you can take a Magic action to magically create a Small or Tiny Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small Eldritch Cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. You can have only one cannon at a time and can’t create one while your cannon is present. Once you create a Cannon, you cannot do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest, unless you expend 2 Ingenuity Points to use it again.

***Cannon’s Statistics.*** The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Artificer level. It is immune to Poison damage and Psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the Mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 Hit Points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

***Cannon Model.*** When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the Flamethrower, Force Ballista and Protector. On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

| Cannon | Activation |
|---|---|
| **Flamethrower** | The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. |
| **Force Ballista** | Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. |
| **Protector** | The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). |

### Level 6: Modular Cannon

When you create an Eldritch Cannon, you can choose one of the following enhancements for it to have:

***Adaptive Cannon.*** Immediately before you activate the Cannon, you can cause it to transform, changing its current type to one of the other options. Once you transform a Cannon twice, you cannot transform that Cannon again.

***Remote Spells.*** When you cast one of your Artificer spells, you can cast it as if you were in the Cannon’s space, using your senses.

Once you enhance a cannon in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you spend an Ingenuity Point to use the feature again.

### Level 9: Explosive Cannon

Every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:

***Extra Damage.*** The cannon’s damage rolls all increase by 1d8.

***Self Destruct.*** As a Magic action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 4d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Level 15: Fortified Position

You’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:

***Half Cover.*** You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10 feet of a Cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.

***Two Cannons.*** You can now have two Cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same Ingenuity Points), and you can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two.
