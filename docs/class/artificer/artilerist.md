# Artilerist

> *Blow Enemies Away with Magical Artillery*

An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds. And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife.

### Level 3: Tool Proficiency

You gain proficiency with Woodcarver's Tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Woodcarver's Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Dexterity.

### Level 3: Artillerist Spells

Your experimentation with explosive magic ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Artillerist Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Artilerist Spells
| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:-:|:--|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Shield], [:spell-lv1: Thunderwave] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Scorching Ray], [:spell-lv2: Shatter] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Fireball], [:spell-lv3: Wind Wall] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Ice Storm], [:spell-lv4: Wall of Fire] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold], [:spell-lv5: Wall of Force] |

### Level 3: Eldritch Cannon

You've learned how to create a magical cannon.

***Creating a Cannon.*** Using Woodcarver's Tools or Smith's Tools, you can take a :rsc-a: **Magic** action to magically create a Small or Tiny Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small Eldritch Cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present. Once you create a Cannon, you cannot do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

***Cannon's Statistics.*** The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Artificer level. It has :dmg-imm: Immunity to :dmg-poison: Poison damage and :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the [:spell-lv0: Mending] spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 Hit Points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

***Cannon Model.*** When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the Flamethrower, Force Ballista and Protector. On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.

| Cannon | Activation (:rsc-b: Bonus Action) |
|---|---|
| *Flamethrower* | The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 :dmg-fire: Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. |
| *Force Ballista* | Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 :dmg-force: Force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon. |
| *Protector* | The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1). |

### Level 5: Arcane Sidearm

Your research has resulted in the creation of a Arcane Sidearm, which uses the following rules:

***Crafting your Sidearm.*** During a long rest, you can spend 1 hour crafting an Arcane Sidearm using woodcarver's tools. You can only have one Arcane Sidearm, and crafting another causes previous Arcane Sidearms to lose their power.

***Appearance.*** An Arcane Sidearm is a Tiny object that can be used as a spellcasting focus for Artificer spells. You choose its appearance, though this has no effect on its abilities. Many Artilerists craft Sidearms that resemble delicate wands of wood, ornate metallic rods, or even runic iron cannons.

***Infusions.*** Your Arcane Sidearm can bear a single Infusion that is meant for an Spellcasting Focus.

***Using your Sidearm.***  When you cast an artificer spell through the sidearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

### Level 9: Explosive Cannon

Every eldritch cannon you create is more destructive:

***Extra Damage.*** The cannon's rolls all increase by 1d8.

***Remote Spells.*** When you cast one of your Artificer spells, you can cast it as if you were in the Cannon's space, using your senses.

***Self Destruct.*** As a :rsc-a: **Magic** action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell Save DC, taking 4d8 :dmg-force: Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Level 15: Fortified Position

You're a master at forming well-defended emplacements using Eldritch Cannon:

***Half Cover.*** You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10 feet of a Cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.

***Two Cannons.*** You can now have two Cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action, and you can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.
