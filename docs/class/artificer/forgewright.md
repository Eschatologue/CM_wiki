# Forgewright Specialisation

While most Artificers are primarily inventors who take up the life of adventure to test experiments in the field, those known as Forgewrights seek out battle for its own sake. Reveling in the thrill of combat, they combine their innovation with their skill as warriors to forge their signature Arcane Armament.

### Level 3: Tools of the Trade

You gain proficiency with Martial Weapons and Smith's Tools. If you already have proficiency with Smith's Tool, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisanâ€™s tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Smith's Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Dexterity.

### Level 3: Forgewright Spells

When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Forgewright Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Artificer Level | Spell |
|---|---|
| 3 | *Compelled Duel*, *Zephyr Strike* |
| 5 | *Esch's Steel Wind Strike*, *Misty Step* |
| 9 | *Blinding Smite*, *Conjure Volley* |
| 13 | *Fire Shield*, *Staggering Smite* |
| 17 | *Banishing Smite*, *Destructive Wave* |

### Level 3: Arcane Armament

Your battlefield research has resulted in the invention of your signature Arcane Armament, which uses the following rules:

***Forging the Armament.*** During a Long Rest, you can spend 1 hour using Smith's Tools to reforge one melee weapon that you are holding into an Arcane Armament. You can only have one Arcane Armament at a time, and forging another causes any previous Armaments to revert to their normal state.

***Properties.*** When you are wielding the Arcane Armament, it counts as a magical weapon, and you can use Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls. It also gains the Thrown (20/60) property, and after you make a thrown attack with it, it instantly returns to your hand. Last, it can be used as a Spellcasting focus for Artificer spells.

***Mastery Properties.*** You can use the mastery properties of your Arcane Armament. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change its mastery property with another eligible one.

***Infusions.*** Your Arcane Armament can bear one Infusion, even though it is a magic weapon. Your number of Infusions Known also increases by 1, but this bonus Infusion
must be applied to your Arcane Armament.

### Level 5: Arcane Jolt

You can channel pure destructive magic through your strikes. Once per turn when you hit with an Arcane Armament attack you can expend a spell slot to deal bonus Force damage to the target. 

This bonus damage 2d8 for a level 1 spell slot and it increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your Artificer cantrip that has the casting time of an action in place of those attack.

### Level 9: Arcane Surge

The magic of your Arcane Armament empowers its strikes. Whenever you hit with an Arcane Armament attack you can deal a bonus 1d8 force damage on hit. Each time you attack with your Arcane Armament, you can forgo this potential bonus damage to instead make your attack with Advantage.

### Level 15: Master Forgewright

You have become a master Forgewright and extend the power of your Arcane Armament to others. As a Bonus Action, you can flood a number of weapons equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet, one of which can be your Arcane Armament, with raw power. For 1 minute, these weapons deal a bonus 1d8 Force damage on hit.

Once you use this feature you must finish a Long Rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses left, you can expend a level 3+ spell slot to use it again.
