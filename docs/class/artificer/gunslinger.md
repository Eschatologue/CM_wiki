# Gunslinger

> *Gun Down your Adversaries*

You have dedicated your great intellect to the development of a one-of-a-kind weapon of war, the Arcane Firearm. Marked by this signature weapon, you enter the fray with the swagger and guile only found in one kind of Artificer, the Gunslinger

### Level 3: Tools of the Trade

You gain proficiency with Alchemist's supplies and Smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan's Tools of your choice.

In addition, whenever you make an ability check with Smith's Tools, you can use your Intelligence as the ability, instead of Strength.

### Level 3: Gunslinger Spells

Your tinkering with Arcane Firearm ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach an Artificer level specified in the Armourer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Gunslinger Spells

| Artificer Level | Spells |
|:-:|:--|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Chaos Bolt], [:spell-lv1: Guiding Bolt] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv2: Melf's Acid Arrow], [:spell-lv2: Aganazzar's Scorcher] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv3: Conjure Barrage], [:spell-lv3: Lightning Arrow] |
| 13 | [:spell-lv4: Banishment], [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield] |
| 17 | [:spell-lv5: Skill Empowerment], [:spell-lv5: Swift Quiver] |

### Level 3: Arcane Firearm

Your groundbreaking research has led to the development of your signature Arcane Firearm, which uses the rules below:

**Crafting your Firearm**{ .inl } During the course of a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can spend 1 hour using smith's tools to craft one Arcane Firearm. It is only usable by you, you are proficient with it, and crafting another causes the magic of the previous Firearm to instantly dispel. You can use your Intelligence, in place of Dexterity for its attack and damage rolls. 

**Infusions**{ .inl } Your Firearm can bear one Infusion for a ranged weapon or an arcane focus. At Artificer level 9 it can bear one additional Infusion.

**Upgrades**{ .inl } Upon creation, your Arcane Firearm gains two Upgrades of your choice from the list of Upgrades at the end of this subclass.

##### Arcane Firearm

| Trait | Details |
|---|---|
| **Weapon Category** | Simple Ranged |
| **Base Damage** | **1d10 + Ability Modifier :dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force .calc } |
| **Properties** | :wp-prop-reload: Reload (6), :wp-prop-range: Ranged (80/320) | 

At certain Artificer levels, your Arcane Firearm gains more Upgrades: at level 5 (3), 10 (4), and 15 (5)

### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action on your turn.
      
Moreover, if you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one Arcane Firearm attack as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on that turn.

### Level 9: Overcharge

You can imbue your Arcane Firearm's attacks with additional explosive magic. Once per turn when you hit a target with an attack from your Arcane Firearm, you can expend a spell slot to cause that attack to deal bonus **:dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage to the target.

This bonus damage is 2d6 for a level 1 spell slot and it increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

### Level 9: Quickdraw

You always seem to shoot first. You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to your **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } rolls. Also, if you roll **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } and don't have the ^^Surprised^^ or the ^^Incapacitated^^ conditon, you can use a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to make one attack with your Arcane Firearm.

### Level 15: Master Gunslinger

Your skill with your Arcane Firearm is nearly supernatural in battle. You can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on your turn to steady your breathing, granting you **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on any attacks you make with your Arcane Firearm until the end of your current turn.

Finally, once per turn when you make an attack with your Arcane Firearm with **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } , you can forgo the **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } to instead make one additional Arcane Firearm attack.

## Gunslinger Upgrades

Below are the Upgrades available to Gunslinger Artificers. If one of your Upgrades has an Artificer level prerequisite, you can use it at the same time you meet that prerequisite.

When one of your Upgrades requires a creature to make a saving throw, it makes its save against your Spell save DC.

=== "Level 3+ Artificer"

    _**Prerequisite:** Level 3+ Artificer_

    When you make a ranged attack with your Arcane Firearm while you have a hostile creature within 5 feet of you, you do not have **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on your attack roll.

    #### Replaceable Parts
