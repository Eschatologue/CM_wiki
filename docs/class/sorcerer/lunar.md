# Lunar Sorcery

> *Unleash the Radiant Power of the Moon*

You or someone from your lineage has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spellsâ€”perhaps making your pupils glow with the color of a moon from your world, causing spectral manifestations of lunar phases to orbit you, or some other effect.

### Level 3: Lunar Embodiment

Whenever you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can choose what Lunar Phase manifests its power through your magic: Full Moon, New Moon, or Crescent Moon.

Your connection to your current Lunar Phase ensures you have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Lunar Spells table, you thereafter always have the spells listed under the column of your current Lunar Phase prepared.

##### Lunar Phase

| Sorcerer Level | Full Moon Spells | New Moon Spells | Crescent Moon Spells |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv2: Lesser Restoration], [:spell-lv1: Shield] | [:spell-lv2: Blindness/Deafness], [:spell-lv1: Ray of Sickness] | [:spell-lv2: Alter Self], [:spell-lv1: Color Spray] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Dispel Magic] | [:spell-lv3: Vampiric Touch] | [:spell-lv3: Phantom Steed] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Death Ward] | [:spell-lv4: Confusion] | [:spell-lv4: Hallucinatory Terrain] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Rary's Telepathic Bond] | [:spell-lv5: Hold Monster] | [:spell-lv5: Mislead] |

### Level 3: Moon Fire

*You can call down the radiant light of the moon on command.*

You always have the [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam] spell prepared, and when you cast it, you can do so by expending two Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot. When you do so, you can move the Cylinder on your subsequent turns using a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } instead of an action.

Starting when you reach level 5 as a Sorcerer, you can cast [:spell-lv2: Moonbeam] as if with a higher level spell slot than level 2, at a rate of 1 extra Sorcery Point per level above 2. The maximum number of Sorcery Points you can spend is equal to  half your Sorcerer level (rounded up) to an overall maximum of 5 Sorcery Points.

### Level 6: Lunar Boons

The current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:

**Full Moon**{.inl} Abjuration and Divination spells.

**New Moon**{.inl} Enchantment and Necromancy spells.

**Crescent Moon**{.inl} Illusion and Transmutation spells.

Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the Sorcery Points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the Sorcery Points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 6: Waxing and Waning

You gain greater control over the phases of your lunar magic.

**Short Rest Phase Shift**{.inl} You can change your current Lunar Phase to a different one when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**.

**Rapid Phase Shift**{.inl} As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can expend 1 Sorcery Point to change your current Lunar Phase to a different one.

### Level 14: Lunar Empowerment

The power of a lunar phase saturates your being. While you are in a Lunar Embodiment phase, you also gain the following benefit associated with that phase:

**Full Moon**{.inl} You can use a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to shed bright light in a 10 foot Emanation and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to douse the light. In addition, you and creatures of your choice have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while within the bright light you shed.

**New Moon**{.inl} You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In addition, while you are entirely in darkness, attack rolls have **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{.d20} against you.

**Crescent Moon**{.inl} You have Resistance to Necrotic and Radiant damage.

### Level 18: Lunar Phenomenon

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can tap into a special power of your current Lunar Embodiment phase. Alternatively, as part of the **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } you take to change your Lunar Phase using the Waxing and Waning feature, you can immediately use the power of the lunar phase you are entering:

**Full Moon**{.inl} You radiate moonlight for a moment. Each creature of your choice within a 30 foot Emanation from you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn. In addition, one creature of your choice in the Emanation regains 3d8 Hit Points.

**New Moon**{.inl} You momentarily emanate gloom. Each creature of your choice 30 foot Emanation from you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 Necrotic damage and have its Speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you have the Invisible condition until the end of your next turn, or until immediately after you make an attack roll or cast a spell.

**Crescent Moon**{.inl} You can magically Teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature Teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that creature have Resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.

Once you use one of these benefits, you can't use that benefit again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points to use it again.
