# Voidwielder

> *Channel the Chaotic Power of Creation*

Before the primordial gods formed the world, there was only the Void. This formless, lightless, writhing chaos desires that all creation should return to it. Voidwielders are Sorcerers who wield the entropic power of the Void, working to undo the very acts of creation. They are often nihilistic in their outlook on life, resigned to the fact that all will eventually dissolve into the nothingness of the great primordial Void.

### Level 3: Entropic Touch

You can channel your sorcerous power to annihilate objects with a touch. As an action, you can expend 2 Sorcery Points and touch a Small or smaller non-magical object that is not being worn or carried, instantly reducing it to a pile of dust.

At certain Sorcerer levels, you are able to destroy objects of greater size with an Entropic Touch: at level 6 (Medium), at 14 (Large), and 17 (Huge).

### Level 3: Soul of the Void

Your innate connection to the primordial void grants you the following benefit: 

***Primordial Language.*** You gain the ability to speak, read, and write Primordial.

***Null Magic.*** Whenever you damage a creature with a Voidwielder Spell, it cannot regain Hit Points or gain Temporary Hit Points until the beginning of your next turn.

### Level 3: Voidwielder Spells

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Voidwielder Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Voidwielder Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Ray of Sickness], [:spell-lv1: Inflict Wounds], [:spell-lv2: Darkness], [:spell-lv2: Ray of Enfeeblement] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Counterspell], [:spell-lv3: Dispel Magic] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Blight], [:spell-lv4: Sickening Radiance] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Antilife Shell], [:spell-lv5: Maelstrom] |

### Level 6: Negate Spell

Your connection to the Void allows you to undo arcane magic, giving your the following benefit:

:spell-lv3: ***Dispel Magic.*** When you cast *Dispel Magic* and you need to make a spellcasting ability check to determine the result, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

:spell-lv3: ***Counterspell.*** When you cast *Counterspell* you can subtract the result of the target's save by a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1).

Once you use one of this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short Rest unless you spend 1 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 14: Ray of Annihilation

Your connection to the Void grants you the power to unmake creation itself. You learn the :spell-lv6 *Disintegrate* spell and you can cast it at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.

Once you use one of this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short Rest unless you spend 7 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 18: Disciple of the Void

As a Bonus Action, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to partially discorporate until the end of your current turn. While you are in this state, you gain the following benefits:

***Force Damage.*** You can cause any Sorcerer spells you cast to deal Force damage.

***Move Through Object.*** You can move through solid objects and creatures as if they were Difficult Terrain. If you end your turn inside a solid object or creature you are instantly shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 Force damage for every 5 feet you were forced to travel. If you pass through a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Spell save DC or take 1d10 Force damage. A creature can only be forced to make this Constitution saving throw once per turn.
