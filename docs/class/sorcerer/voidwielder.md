# Voidwielder

> *Channel the Chaotic Power of Creation - Written by Laserllama - Adapted to 2024 PHB by Eschatologue*

Before the primordial gods formed the world, there was only the Void. This formless, lightless, writhing chaos desires that all creation should return to it. Voidwielders are Sorcerers who wield the entropic power of the Void, working to undo the very acts of creation. They are often nihilistic in their outlook on life, resigned to the fact that all will eventually dissolve into the nothingness of the great primordial Void.

### Level 3: Entropic Touch

You can channel the power of the void and send one Tiny or smaller object that you touch into the Void. The item must be non-magical in nature, and cannot be on object that is being worn or carried by another creature.

It remains in the Void for as long as you Concentrate on this ability, as if Concentrating on a spell. When you maintain Concentration for 1 hour, the object is permanently destroyed. If you break your concentration, the object reappears in an unoccupied space as close as possible to its last location.

You can use this feature once without expending Sorcery Points, and cannot do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend 1 Sorcery Points to use it again.

The size of the non-magical item you can target with this feature increases as you gain levels in this class: at Level 6 (Medium), Level 11 (Large), and again at Level 17 (Huge).

### Level 3: Soul of the Void

Your innate connection to the primordial void grants you the ability to speak, read, and write Primordial.

### Level 3: Voidwielder Spells

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace one spell from this feature with another Abjuration or Necromancy spell of the same level from the Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard list.

##### Voidwuelder Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | *Darkness*, *Inflict Wounds*, *Ray of Sickness*, *Ray of Enfeeblement* |
| 5 | *Counterspell*, *Dispel Magic* |
| 7 | *Blight*, *Sickening Radiance* |
| 9 | *Antilife Shell*, *Maelstrom* |

### Level 6: Negate Spell

Your connection to the Void allows you to undo arcane magic. When you cast *Counterspell* or *Dispel Magic* and you need to make a spellcasting ability check to determine the result, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Short Rest unless you spend 1 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 14: Disciple of the Void

When you use Entropic Touch, you can send a total number of objects equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) into the Void at one time. Only one object can be maximum size; the rest must be Small. If you use this ability again, you must choose an object to reappear.

### Level 18: Ray of Annihilation

Your connection to the Void grants you the power to unmake creation itself. You learn the *Disintegrate* spell, and you can cast it without expending a spell slot. When you cast *Disintegrate* this way, it is cast at the level of your highest available spell slot. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses after a Long Rest.
