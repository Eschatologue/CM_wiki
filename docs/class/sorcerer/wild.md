# Sorcerous Origin: Wild Magic

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

## Level 3: Wild Magic Surge

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. No more than once per turn, you can roll a d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.

If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires Concentration, it doesn't require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
