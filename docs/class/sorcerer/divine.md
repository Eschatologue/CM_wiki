# Divine Soul

> *Channel Magic of the Upper Planes*

Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a Sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a godâ€™s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.

A Divine Sorcerer, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Sorcerer can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.

In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Sorcerer may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.

### Level 3: Divine Magic

Your link to the Divine allows you to learn spells from the Cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a Sorcerer cantrip or prepare a Sorcerer spell of level 1 or higher, you can choose the new spell from the Cleric spell list or the Sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell.

In addition, your connection to a Divine source of magic ensures that you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Divine Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Divine Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Cure Wounds], [:spell-lv2: Enhance Ability], [:spell-lv1: Protection from Evil and Good], [:spell-lv2: Spiritual Weapon] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Mass Healing Word], [:spell-lv3: Revivify] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Death Ward], [:spell-lv4: Guardian of Faith] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Commune], [:spell-lv5: Summon Celestial] |

### Level 3: Favored by the Gods

Divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a D20 Test, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. You cannot use this feature multiple times on the same roll.

### Level 6: Potent Healing

Whenever you cast a spell that restores Hit Points to a creature, you can modify that spell in one of the following ways:

**Empowered Healing**{.inl} You can add your Charisma modifier to one of the spell's healing rolls.

**Discounted Metamagic**{.inl} You can reduce the cost of one of your Metamagic options on that spell by **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)**.

### Level 14: Otherworldly Wings

You can take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. The wings last until you have the Incapacitated condition, you die, or you dismiss them as a  **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc}.

The wings have an appearance of your choice, and may take on an appearance fitting to the source of your divine power: eagle wings for good aligned sources, bat wings for evil and dragonfly wings for neutral.

### Level 18: Unearthly Recovery

You gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries. As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} when you are Bloodied, you can regain a number of Hit Points equal to half your Hit Point Maximum.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, unless you spend 6 Sorcery Points to restore its use (no action required).
