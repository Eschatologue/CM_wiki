# Sorcerous Origin: Stone Sorcery

Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.

Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Level 3: Stoneblood

Your connection to the earth grants Martial Weapon proficiency and armor training with Shields.

Moreover, your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of one kind of Simple or Martial weapon with which you have proficiency. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kind of weapon you chose to another eligible kind.

### Level 3: Metal Magic

Your affinity for metal gives you the option to learn some non-sorcerer spells that focus on weapon attacks. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a level 1+ sorcerer spell, you can select the spell from the following list of spells, in addition to the sorcerer spell list. 

You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

##### Metal Magic
| Spell Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 1 | *Compelled Duel*, *Searing Smite*, *Thunderous Smite*, *Wrathful Smite* |
| 2 | *Branding Smite*, *Blinding Smite*, *Elemental Weapon*, *Magic Weapon* |
| 3 | *Staggering Smite* |

### Level 3: Stone's Durability

Your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

As Magic action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Charisma Modifier if you aren't wearing armor, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it (no action required), you have the Incapacitated condition, or you don armor other than a shield.

### Level 6: Stone Aegis

Your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection.

As a Bonus Action, you can grant an aegis to you or one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage the target takes is reduced by a number equals to your Charisma modifier. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and it ends earlt if you you use it again, or when you have the Incapacitated condition.

### Level 6: Extra Attack

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action. 

### Level 14: Stone's Edge

When you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra Force damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

### Level 18: Earth Master's Aegis

When you use your Stone's Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.
