# Stone Sorcery

> *Master the Magic from the Earth*

Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.

Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Level 3: Stoneblood

Your connection to the earth grants Martial Weapon proficiency and training with Shields.

Moreover, your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of one kind of Simple or Martial weapon with which you have proficiency. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kind of weapon you chose to another eligible kind.

### Level 3: Metal Magic

Your affinity for metal gives you the option to learn some non-sorcerer spells that focus on weapon attacks. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a level 1+ Sorcerer spell, you can select the spell from the Metal Magic table, in addition to the Sorcerer spell list. 

You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a Sorcerer spell for you.

##### Metal Magic

| Spell Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 1 | [:spell-lv1: Compelled Duel], [:spell-lv1: Searing Smite], [:spell-lv1: Thunderous Smite], [:spell-lv1: Wrathful Smite] |
| 2 | [:spell-lv2: Elemental Weapon], [:spell-lv2: Magic Weapon], [:spell-lv2: Shining Smite] |
| 3 | [:spell-lv3: Blinding Smite] |
| 4 | [:spell-lv4: Staggering Smite] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv5: Banishing Smite] |

### Level 3: Stone's Durability

Your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

As Magic action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Charisma Modifier if you aren't wearing armour, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it (no action required), you have the Incapacitated condition, or you don armour other than a Shield.

### Level 6: Stone Aegis

Your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection.

As a Bonus Action, you grant yourself or an ally within 60 feet an aegis of earth magic. For 1 minute, Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage the target takes is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. This effect ends early if you use it again or when you have Incapacitated condition.

Additionally, when an enemy hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your Reaction to teleport within 5 feet of the attacker (if on the same surface) and make a melee attack. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 1d10 Force damage (increases to 2d10 at level 11, and 3d10 at level 17).

### Level 14: Stone's Edge

When you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra Force damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

### Level 18: Earth Master's Aegis

When you use your Stone's Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.
