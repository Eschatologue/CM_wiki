# Stone Sorcery

> *Master Magic from the Earth*

Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.

Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Level 3: Stoneblood

Your connection to the earth grants you the following benefits:

***Extra Hit Points.*** Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

***Proficiencies.*** You gain proficiency with Martial Weapon proficiency and training with Shields.

***Reinforce.*** As :rsc-a: **Magic** action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Charisma Modifier if you aren't wearing armour, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect ends if you end it (no action required), you have the Incapacitated condition, or you don armour other than a Shield.

### Level 3: Metal Magic

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Metal Magic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Metal Magic Spells

| Spell Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Earth Tremor], [:spell-lv1: Sanctuary], [:spell-lv2: Magic Weapon], [:spell-lv2: Spike Growth]|
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Erupting Earth], [:spell-lv3: Meld into Stone] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Stone Shape], [:spell-lv4: Summon Elemental] (Earth only) |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Banishing Smite], [:spell-lv5: Wall of Stone] |

### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your Sorcerer cantrip that has the casting time of an action in place of those attack.

### Level 6: Stone Aegis

Your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection.

As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you grant yourself or an ally within 60 feet an aegis of earth magic. For 1 minute, :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning, :dmg-prcg: Piercing, or :dmg-slsh: Slashing damage the target takes is reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. This effect ends early if you use it again or when you have Incapacitated condition.

Additionally, when an enemy hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your :rsc-r: Reaction to teleport within 5 feet of the attacker (if on the same surface) and make a melee attack. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 2d6 Force damage (increases to 3d6 at level 11, and 4d6 at level 17).

### Level 14: Crushing Blow

You strikes is empowered with crushing force. Once per turn when you hit with a Melee weapon attack or Unarmed Strike you can expend a spell slot to deal bonus :dmg-force: Force damage to the target. 

This bonus damage is 2d6 for a level 1 spell slot and it increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

### Level 14: Stone's Edge

When you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra Force damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.

### Level 18: Earth Master's Aegis

When you use your Stone's Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.
