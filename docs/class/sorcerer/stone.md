# Stone Sorcery

> *Master Magic from the Earth*

Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth is yours to command.

Your link to earth magic grants you extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to overwhelm your foes.

### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with Martial weapon and training with Shields.

### Level 3: Stoneblood

Elemental earth fortifies your body. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Moreover, as :rsc-a: **Magic** action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Constitution modifier if you aren't wearing armour, and your skin assumes a stony appearance. This effect ends if you end it (no action required), you have the Unconcious condition, or you don armour other than a Shield.

### Level 3: Metal Magic

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Metal Magic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Metal Magic Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv0: Mold Earth], [:spell-lv1: Earth Tremor], [:spell-lv1: Thunderous Smite], [:spell-lv2: Maximilian's Earthen Grasp], [:spell-lv2: Spike Growth]|
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Erupting Earth], [:spell-lv3: Meld into Stone] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Stone Shape], [:spell-lv4: Summon Elemental] (Earth only) |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Transmute Rock], [:spell-lv5: Wall of Stone] |

### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of your Sorcerer cantrip that has the casting time of an action in place of those attack.

### Level 6: Stone Aegis

*Your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness it for your allies' protection.*

As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can touch a willing creature (including yourself) and and expend Sorcery Points to grant it 1d6 Temporary Hit Points per Sorcery Point.

When a creature with these Temporary Hit Points within 60 feet of you that you can see is hit by a melee attack, you can use your :rsc-r: Reaction to teleport within 5 feet of the attacker and make a Melee attack or Unarmed Strike against it.

### Level 14: Mountain's Heart

*Your sorcerous magic is as hard as the bedrock of mountains.*

When creatures have Stone Aegis' Temporary Hit Points, they have :dmg-res: Resistance to :dmg-bldg: Bludgeoning, :dmg-prcg: Piercing, and :dmg-slsh: Slashing damage. They also has :dmg-imm: Immunity to Forced Movement.

### Level 18: Earth Master's Aegis

When you use your Stone's Aegis to protect an ally, you can choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.
