# Arcane Soul

> *Unleash Pure, Unfiltered, Arcane Power*

Your sorcerous power are drawn from an innate connection with the Weave, the very foundation of magic itself. Where a wizard would tap into the Weave through precise incanatation and careful study, you are the one with it, shaping it through sheer instinct and willpower.

### Level 3: Arcane Attunement

You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't have it already. Whenever you would make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, you can choose to make a Charisma (Arcana) check instead.

When you cast a Sorcerer spell, you can ignore any material component that isn't consumed by the spell and doesn't have a gold cost

### Level 3: Arcane Magic

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Arcane Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Arcane Spells
| Sorcerer Level | Spell |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic], [:spell-lv1: Magic Missile], [:spell-lv2: Magic Weapon], [:spell-lv2: Nystul's Magic Aura] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Counterspell], [:spell-lv3: Pulse Wave](../../spells/description/additional/dunamancy.md#pulse-wave) |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Arcane Eye], [:spell-lv4: Banishment] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Bigby's Hand], [:spell-lv5: Scrying] |

### Level 6: Spell Deflection

*You learn to twist the spells of your enemies to your will.* 

When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses you, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level and partially redirect that spell at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip), under the following rules:

***Attack Roll.*** If the triggering effect was an attack roll, the roll is repeated against that creature, using your Sorcerer spell attack modifier. 

***Saving Throw.*** If the triggering effect was a saving throw, the creature makes its own saving throw against that effect, using your Sorcerer spell save DC. The deflected effect treats you as its caster for all other purposes. The initial effects of the spell are otherwise unchanged.

The deflected spell must be of a level you can cast. This ability cannot be used against area effects, such as the explosion of a [:spell-lv3: Fireball].

### Level 14: Magic Avoidance

You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on saving throws against spells. Furthermore, when you use your Spell Deflection ability, any effect of the triggering spell against you is negated.

### Level 18: Share Metamagic

*Your mastery over magic allows you to empower the spells of your allies.*

When a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to apply a Metamagic option that you know to that spell. You determine how to use the Metamagic option you grant the caster. You must obey all other restrictions for that Metamagic option and spend sorcery points as normal.

Once you grant a metamagic option to a creature with this feature, you can't grant that creature a metamagic option again until it finishes a short or long rest
