# Spellfire Sorcery

> *Radiate Raw Magic Potential*

Your sorcerous power are drawn from an innate connection with the Weave, the very foundation of magic itself. Where a wizard would tap into the Weave through precise incanatation and careful study, you are the one with it, shaping it through sheer instinct and willpower.

### Level 3: Spellfire Burst

When you spend at least **1 :class-phb24-sorcerer: Sorcery Point(s)** as part of the **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action or a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on your turn, you can unleash one of the following magical effects of your choice. You can do so only once per turn.

**Bolstering Flames**{ .inl } You or one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself gains **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** equal to `1d4 plus your Charisma modifier`. 

**Radiant Fire**{ .inl } One creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself must succeed on a **:d20-save: Dexterity saving throw**{ .d20 } against your Spell Save DC or take `1d6` **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } or **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } damage (your choice). 

### Level 3: Spellfire Magic

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Spellfire Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Spellfire Spells

| Sorcerer <br>Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Cure Wounds], [:spell-lv1: Guiding Bolt], [:spell-lv2: Lesser Restoration], [:spell-lv2: Scorching Ray] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Aura of Vitality], [:spell-lv3: Dispel Magic] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Fire Shield], [:spell-lv4: Wall of Fire] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Greater Restoration], [:spell-lv5: Flame Strike] |

### Level 6: Absorb Spells

You always have [:spell-lv3: Counterspell] prepared. Additionally, whenever a target fails the saving throw against a [:spell-lv3: Counterspell] you cast, you regain **1d4 :class-phb24-sorcerer: Sorcery Point(s)**. 

### Level 14: Honed Spellfire

Your *Spellfire Burst* improves. You add your Sorcerer level to the **:trt-thp: Temporary Hit Points** gained from *Bolstering Flames*, and the 1d6 of *Radiant Fire* increases to 3d6. 

### Level 18: Crown of Spellfire

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute. Once you use this **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend **7 :class-phb24-sorcerer: Sorcery Point(s)** (no action required) to restore your use of it. 
 
**Burning Life Force**{ .inl } Once per turn when you are hit by an attack roll, you can expend a number of Hit Dice, up to a maximum equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). Roll the expended dice and reduce the amount of damage from that attack equal to the total rolled plus your Sorcerer level. 

**Flight**{ .inl } You gain a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. 

**Spell Avoidance**{ .inl } When you’re subjected to a spell or magical effect that allows you to make a saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this benefit if you have the Incapacitated condition.
