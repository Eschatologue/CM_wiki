# Storm Sorcery

> *Unleash the Crackling Storm Within*

Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.

Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.

### Level 3: Storm Magic

Your connection to the storm ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Storm Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Storm Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Fog Cloud], [:spell-lv2: Gust of Wind], [:spell-lv1: Thunderwave], [:spell-lv2: Warding Wind] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Call Lightning], [:spell-lv3: Sleet Storm] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Storm Sphere], [:spell-lv4: Ice Storm] |

### Level 3: Storm Within

You have an arcane storm whirling through your body. Immediately before or after you cast a spell of level 1 or higher, you can cause your inner storm to manifest in one of the following ways.

***Tempestuous Ascent.*** Elemental air carries you aloft. You fly up to 10 feet without provoking Opportunity Attacks. You safely descend at the start of your next turn.

***Arcane Tempest.*** You whip up an arcane storm around you. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Strength save. On a failed save, they are pushed 10 feet away from you in a straight line.

If your Innate Sorcery is active, the distance you can fly or push creatures away is doubled.

### Level 6: Stormladen

You are overflowing with storming energy.

***Lightning Rod.*** You have Resistance to Lightning and Thunder damage.

***Storm Transmutation.*** When you cast a spell  that deals Acid, Cold, Fire or Poison damage, you can change that damage type to Lightning or Thunder.

### Level 6: Arcane Conductivity

Whenever you deal Lightning or Thunder damage with a Sorcerer spell that requires you to make an attack roll, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to let your storm energy arc towards nearby targets. Choose up to two different creatures within 15 feet of the original target. Each creature must succeed on a Dexterity save or take 2d6 Lightning or Thunder damage (your choice). When your Innate Sorcery is active, you choose an additional target.

### Level 14: Heart of the Storm

Whenever you use your Storm Within feature, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to gain the following benefits.

***Armor of Winds.*** When you choose your Tempestuous Ascent option, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class and Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn. If your Innate Sorcery is active, the bonus is +3 instead.

***Triboelectric.*** When you choose your Arcane Tempest option, any creature that failed its save also takes 2d6 Lightning or Thunder damage (your choice). If your Innate Sorcery is active, the damage is 3d6 instead.

### Level 18: Wind Soul

The storm inside of you becomes more powerful.

***One with the Storm.*** You have immunity to Lightning and Thunder damage and you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

***Blessing of the Tempest.*** As a Magic action, you can reduce your Fly Speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a Fly Speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.
