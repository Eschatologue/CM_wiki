# Storm Sorcery

> *Unleash the Crackling Storm Within*

Your innate magic comes from the power of elemental air. Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.

Storm sorcerers are invaluable members of a ship's crew. Their magic allows them to exert control over wind and weather in their immediate area. Their abilities also prove useful in repelling attacks by sahuagin, pirates, and other waterborne threats.

### Level 3: Storm Magic

Your connection to the storm ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Storm Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Storm Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|:-:|---|
| 3 | [:spell-lv1: Fog Cloud], [:spell-lv2: Gust of Wind], [:spell-lv1: Thunderwave], [:spell-lv2: Warding Wind] |
| 5 | [:spell-lv3: Call Lightning], [:spell-lv3: Sleet Storm] |
| 7 | [:spell-lv4: Storm Sphere], [:spell-lv4: Ice Storm] |
| 9 | [:spell-lv5: Cone of Cold], [:spell-lv5: Maelstrom] |

### Level 3: Tempestuous Magic

You have an arcane storm whirling through your body. Immediately before or after you cast a Sorcerer spell of level 1 or higher, you can fly up to 10 feet without provoking **:rsc-r: Opportunity Attacks**. You safely descend at the start of your next turn. This distance is doubled if your **Innate Sorcery** is active.

### Level 6: Heart of the Storm

You are overflowing with storming energy. You gain the following benefits.

**Lightning Rod**{.inl} You have **:dmg-res: Resistance** to **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } and **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } damage.

**Potent Storm**{.inl} Whenever you deal **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } damage with a Sorcerer spell that requires you to make an attack roll, you can cause a small storm to erupt. Each creature within 20 feet of your target takes **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } equals to half of your Sorcerer level respectively.

### Level 6: Storm Transmutation

When you cast a spell that deals **:dmg-acid: Acid**{ .dmg-acid }, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{ .dmg-cold }, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } or **:dmg-posn: Poison**{ .dmg-posn } damage, you can change that damage type to **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun }.

### Level 14: Storm's Fury

When you are hit by a Melee attack, the attacker takes **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } or **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } damage (choose each time) equals to your **Sorcerer level**. Moreover, when you deal these damage, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction** to force the attacker to make a **:d20-save: STR save** against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed 20 feet away from you in a straight line.

### Level 18: Wind Soul

The storm inside of you becomes more powerful.

**One with the Storm**{.inl} You have **:dmg-imm: Immunity** to **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn } and **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } damage and you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

**Blessing of the Tempest**{.inl} As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action, you can reduce your Fly Speed to 30 feet for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. The chosen creatures gain a Fly Speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
