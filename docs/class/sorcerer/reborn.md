# The Reborn

> *Regain Your Lost Powers*

You once wielded power that rivalled the gods, or perhaps you were one of them. Now, through some misfortune, you’ve been reborn—a fragment of your former self. Yet, the essence of your past greatness lingers, waiting to be reignited. With each spell cast, you edge closer to reclaiming the glory and might that was once yours. Will you rise again, or be forgotten in this new life?

### Level 3: Ancient Mind

You have access to lost knowledge from eons long dead. You gain the following benefits:

***Bonus Language.*** You learn to speak, read, and write, two exotic languages of your choice.

***Bonus Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency in Religion and History. You can use your Charisma instead of Intelligence for checks using these skills.

### Level 3: Reborn Spell

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Reborn Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Reborn Spells

| Sorcerer Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 3 | *Command*, *False Life*, *Augury*, *Identify* |
| 5 | *Clairvoyance*, *Hold Person* |
| 7 | *Banishment*, *Divination* |
| 9 | *Legend Lore*, *Yolande's Regal Presence* |

### Level 3: Shape of Magic

In an age long forgotten, before the usurpers reform the practice of spellcasting, you grasped the original truths of the Weave. Your connection to ancient arcane forces gives you the following benefits:

***Bonus Cantrip.***  You learn an additional Cantrip from any spell list. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace this cantrip with another cantrip of your choice from any spell list.

***Arcane Architect.*** You gain one additional metamagic option of your choice from the Metamagic Options. You gain one more Metamagic known when you reach level 10 and 14 in this class.

### Level 6: Echoes of Forgotten

Your connection to the ancient Weave allows you to tap into long-lost arcane energies, granting you fleeting glimpses of spells once beyond your reach. With this power, you can momentarily access forgotten magic.

***Echoes of Spell.*** Once per Long Rest, you can cast a spell of your choice that you have not prepared from the Sorcerer spell list, as long as the spell’s level is equal to or lower than your highest available level of spell slot. You must expend Sorcery Points equal to the cost of creating a spell slot of that level, as shown in the [Creating Spell Slots table](index.md#creating-spell-slots).

***Magical Flux.***  Once per Long Rest, you can replace one spell you know with another Sorcerer spell of your choice. You can also replace one of the Metamagic effects that you know with another Metamagic effect of your choice.

### Level 14: Transcendent Passage

You can slip through the seams of existence. When you spent Sorcery Points, you can teleport a number of feet equal to 5 times the number of Sorcery Points spent, appearing in an unoccupied space within range.

### Level 18: Ascended Arcana

Spells bend to your will as they once did in your former life, and your mastery over metamagic allows you to reshape reality itself.

***Limitless Metamagic.*** When you use Metamagic, you can choose to apply three different Metamagic options instead of two whenever your Innate Sorcery is active. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and regain all uses after a Long Rest.
