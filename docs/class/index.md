# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

## A World That Demands Adaptation

Antares is a world ravaged by the devastating Warp Storms. Kingdoms fell, gods grew silent, and knowledge was scattered to the winds. In this broken world, survival depends not on tradition but on adaptation. Magic, martial arts, divine pacts, and ancient relics have been salvaged, mixed, and reforged into new forms.

In Antares, power is not bound by rigid disciplines. It is stolen, traded, rediscovered, and repurposed. A Fighter may forge pacts with eldritch entities, a Wizard might wield firearms, a Druid could shape metal as easily as flesh, and Clerics may draw power from cosmic aberrations. This is not creativity—it’s survival.

The lines between classes have blurred beyond recognition. Techniques, feats, and magics from across time and culture now coexist because the world demands it. In Antares, pragmatism often outweighs tradition.

### Player Character Classes

Due to the nature of Antares, many traditional class identities have shifted, with only their mechanics remaining relatively intact. These changes are largely a reflection of the world’s new reality.

**Artificers**{.inl} Once a subdiscipline of wizards, artificers have forged their own identity in the wake of the Warp. Artifice is still a fledgling field, blending the long-established magic of Gallia with the cutting-edge technology of Albion. These "Technomancers" are a new breed of spellcasters who combine the old and the new, using arcane knowledge to manipulate machinery and create powerful constructs. Though many call them Technomancers, the term "Artificer" is preferred, as it represents their unique philosophy of creation.

**Barbarians**{.inl} Once fierce warriors of the untamed wilderness, Barbarians now often live on the fringes of society. As the wilderness of Antares grows increasingly dangerous, many wanderers find themselves seeking refuge in the crowded Citadel Cities. Often disguised as common folk or farmhands, they bide their time until the Warp's influence threatens the city. When that day comes, these primal warriors are the first to take up arms and defend their home.

**Clerics**{.inl} Clerics are a unique class of spellcasters who draw their power not from arcane knowledge, but from divine sources. In Antares, the gods of old have perished, and their domains have been replaced by the enigmatic Spires. The Spires are philosophical ideals—concepts like Destruction, Harmony, or Judgement. Clerics now follow the teachings of these Spires, interpreting their messages through the lens of their own beliefs. A good-aligned Cleric might worship the Spire of Destruction through the lens of creation, while an evil Cleric might see only the need for complete annihilation.

**Druids**{.inl} Druids in Antares are more than just guardians of nature. They are deeply connected to the world’s environment, whether that be a forgotten grove in the wilderness, a polluted cityscape, or the heavens above. Some Druids still harness the power of the natural world, while others draw upon the machine gods or the celestial bodies to fuel their magic. Their abilities are deeply tied to their origins, whether earthly or celestial, and their power often reflects the landscape they protect—or the technology they embrace.

**Fighters**{.inl} In a world where combat is often the only way to survive, Fighters are ubiquitous. While some focus purely on martial prowess, many augment their skills with magic, psionics, pacts with eldritch entities, or simply by hitting things hard. In Antares, no one survives for long without the ability to wield a weapon or control a fight. Whether through raw strength or tactical genius, Fighters play a critical role in the defense of this world.

**Magus**{.inl} The Magus represents the blend of martial skill and magical power. They are part of ancient orders, each one specializing in a particular aspect of the arcane. Some Magi protect their allies with magic, while others use it to destroy their enemies or counteract the powers of other spellcasters. Although they originally came from Gallia, many Magi have been scattered across Antares, where their orders continue their work in new and often dangerous lands. A Magus does not wield both sword or spell seperately, they wield them in tandem.

**Monks**{.inl} Monks are rare in Antares, as their monastic traditions were often destroyed by the Warp. However, some monasteries have adapted to the changing world by relocating to Citadel Cities, where they take on new roles. Some become actors showcasing martial arts, while others serve as humanitarian organizations, helping the displaced and downtrodden while still preserving their martial training.

**Paladins**{.inl} Often confused with Magi due to their shared focus on orders, codes, and ethics, but the key difference lies in their Oaths. Paladins draw their power not from study or patronage, but from the strength of their belief in the oath they’ve sworn—be it vengeance, glory, redemption, or ancient ideals. Their unwavering commitment to these oaths manifests as tangible power, allowing them to perform feats of strength, righteousness, and, of course, smiting.

**Sorcerers**{.inl} Sorcerers in Antares are most commonly human, and their magical abilities are often viewed as a result of innate talent rather than years of study. Many humans in Antares trace their origins to Gallia, where magical prowess was a measure of one's social status. Though their power is raw and unpredictable, Sorcerers can be incredibly effective—especially when they learn to harness their abilities through self-discipline or study.

**Rangers**{.inl} Rangers are the experts in navigating the treacherous landscapes of Antares, whether in the urban labyrinths of the Citadel Cities or the dangerous wilds beyond. Known for their stealth and tracking skills, Rangers are also exceptional bounty hunters, making them a common—and lucrative—profession in Antares. Those who venture into the unknown often find Rangers by their side, helping them survive in environments that most would never dare enter.

**Wizards**{.inl} Wizards are the quintessential scholars of magic, delving into ancient tomes and arcane studies to unlock the secrets of the universe. They represent a more traditional approach to magic than Sorcerers, who rely on innate power. Wizards are often seen as the academics of Antares, respected for their dedication to knowledge and craft. However, the rise of self-taught magic users has led to a shift in the wizarding community, with many seeing it as a new age of discovery.

**Warlocks**{.inl} Warlocks are spellcasters who make pacts with powerful entities in exchange for supernatural abilities. In Antares, Warlocks are often misunderstood, their relationship with their patrons viewed with suspicion or even fear. They are sometimes mistaken for Sorcerers or Wizards due to their magical abilities, but their powers come from the beings they have bound themselves to—beings whose motives are often as mysterious as the Warlocks themselves.

## Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common.

##### Class Group {data-toc="Class Group Table"}

| **Group** | **Classes** | **What They're Known For** |
|---|---|---|
| **Experts** | Artificer^TCE^, Bard, Ranger, Rogue | Adaptive and polymaths. They blend skills, tools, and cunning—masters of precision, stealth, and knowing more than they let on. |
| **Mages** | Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard | Wielders of arcane forces, both learned and instinctual. They manipulate reality, unleash devastation, or channel forgotten pacts and secrets. |
| **Priests** | Cleric, Druid, Paladin | Keepers of divine whispers and primal forces. Whether from gods, nature, or sacred oaths, their power shields, heals, and reshapes life itself. |
| **Warriors** | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Magus^LL^ | Blades, fists, grit. These are the ones who charge into the fire, crack skulls, and live to tell the tale. Discipline or rage—pain is their language. |

## New Features

*Crown & Misery* introduces additional mechanics designed to expand and refine character customization beyond the 2024 Player’s Handbook. This section details new features that are tied directly to character classes. Features that apply universally, or are not specific to a single class, are described in separate sections of this document.

### Weapon Masteries: Expanded

*Main Article: [Weapon Masteries](../equipment/weapon/mastery.md)*

<!-- --8<-- [start:wp-mas-ex] -->

This new feature expands your base class Weapon Mastery feature. You gain the following option when you use Weapon Mastery.

###### Replace Weapon Mastery
When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can also **replace the Mastery property** of any weapon you are using with another eligible property. For example, you could change a Longsword’s **:wp-mas: Sap**{ .wp } property to **:wp-mas: Flex**{ .wp }.  

###### Multiple Mastery on One Weapon
When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can instead **assign an additional _eligible_ Mastery property** to a weapon you already chose. A weapon can have **no more than four** mastery properties at a time. If a weapon has multiple mastery properties, you can **only use one of them per attack**. You must choose which mastery property you're using before making the attack.
