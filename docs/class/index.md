# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

## A World That Demands Adaptation

With its constant Warp Storms, nothing in Antares remained untouched—kingdoms fell, gods went silent, and knowledge scattered like ash. The survivors had to rebuild not from tradition, but from scraps. Magic, martial training, divine pacts, and strange relics were salvaged, mixed, and reforged into something new.

In Antares, power isn’t bound by rigid paths. It’s stolen, traded, rediscovered, and repurposed. A Fighter forge pacts with eldritch entities; a Wizard might wield firearms; a Druid could shape metal as easily as fles; a Cleric that draws power from a cosmic abberation. This isn’t creativity—it’s survival.

No school of thought is pure anymore. The lines between disciplines have blurred beyond recognition. Feats, techniques, and magic from across ages and cultures now coexist because they must. In a world this broken, pragmatism beats tradition every time.

## Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common. 

| **Group** | **Classes** | **What They're Known For** |
|---|---|---|
| **Experts** | Artificer^TCE^, Bard, Ranger, Rogue | Adaptive and polymaths. They blend skills, tools, and cunning—masters of precision, stealth, and knowing more than they let on. |
| **Mages** | Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard | Wielders of arcane forces, both learned and instinctual. They manipulate reality, unleash devastation, or channel forgotten pacts and secrets. |
| **Priests** | Cleric, Druid, Paladin | Keepers of divine whispers and primal forces. Whether from gods, nature, or sacred oaths, their power shields, heals, and reshapes life itself. |
| **Warriors** | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Magus^LL^ | Blades, fists, grit. These are the ones who charge into the fire, crack skulls, and live to tell the tale. Discipline or rage—pain is their language. |

## New Features

*Crown & Misery* introduces additional mechanics designed to expand and refine character customization beyond the 2024 Player’s Handbook. This section details new features that are tied directly to character classes. Features that apply universally, or are not specific to a single class, are described in separate sections of this document.

### Weapon Masteries: Expanded

*Main Article: [Weapon Masteries](../equipment/weapon/mastery.md)*

<!-- --8<-- [start:wp-mas-ex] -->

This new feature expands your base class Weapon Mastery feature. You gain the following option when you use Weapon Mastery.

###### Replace Weapon Mastery
When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can also **replace the Mastery property** of any weapon you are using with another eligible property. For example, you could change a Longsword’s **:wp-mas: Sap**{ .wp } property to **:wp-mas: Flex**{ .wp }.  

###### Multiple Mastery on One Weapon
When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can instead **assign an additional _eligible_ Mastery property** to a weapon you already chose. A weapon can have **no more than four** mastery properties at a time. If a weapon has multiple mastery properties, you can **only use one of them per attack**. You must choose which mastery property you're using before making the attack.
