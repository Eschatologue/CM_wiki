# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

### Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common. 

| Group | Classes | Characteristics |
|---|---|---|
| **Experts** | Artificer, Bard, Ranger, Rogue | Polymaths who have the Expertise feature and elements of other classes |
| **Mages** | Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard | Adepts of Arcane magic who focus on utility and destruction |
| **Priests** | Cleric, Druid, Paladin | Stewards of Divine or Primal magic who focus on healing, utility, and defense |
| **Warriors** | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk | Masters of combat who can deal and endure many wounds |
