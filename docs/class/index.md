# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

## A World That Demands Adaptation

With its constant Warp Storms, nothing in Antares remained untouched—kingdoms fell, gods went silent, and knowledge scattered like ash. The survivors had to rebuild not from tradition, but from scraps. Magic, martial training, divine pacts, and strange relics were salvaged, mixed, and reforged into something new.

In Antares, power isn’t bound by rigid paths. It’s stolen, traded, rediscovered, and repurposed. A Fighter forge pacts with eldritch entities; a Wizard might wield firearms; a Druid could shape metal as easily as fles; a Cleric that draws power from a cosmic abberation. This isn’t creativity—it’s survival.

No school of thought is pure anymore. The lines between disciplines have blurred beyond recognition. Feats, techniques, and magic from across ages and cultures now coexist because they must. In a world this broken, pragmatism beats tradition every time.

## Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common. 

| **Group** | **Classes** | **What They're Known For** |
|---|---|---|
| **Experts** | Artificer^TCE^, Bard, Ranger, Rogue | Adaptive and polymaths. They blend skills, tools, and cunning—masters of precision, stealth, and knowing more than they let on. |
| **Mages** | Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard | Wielders of arcane forces, both learned and instinctual. They manipulate reality, unleash devastation, or channel forgotten pacts and secrets. |
| **Priests** | Cleric, Druid, Paladin | Keepers of divine whispers and primal forces. Whether from gods, nature, or sacred oaths, their power shields, heals, and reshapes life itself. |
| **Warriors** | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Magus^LL^ | Blades, fists, grit. These are the ones who charge into the fire, crack skulls, and live to tell the tale. Discipline or rage—pain is their language. |

## New Features

*Crown & Misery* introduces additional mechanics designed to expand and refine character customization beyond the 2024 Player’s Handbook. This section details new features that are tied directly to character classes. Features that apply universally, or are not specific to a single class, are described in separate sections of this document.

### Weapon Masteries: Expanded

*Main Article: [Weapon Masteries](../equipment/weapon/mastery.md)*

<!-- --8<-- [start:wp-mas-ex] -->

This new feature expands your base class Weapon Mastery feature. You gain the following option when you use Weapon Mastery.

**Replace Weapon Mastery**{.inl} When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can also **replace the Mastery property** of any weapon you are using with another eligible property. For example, you could change a Longsword’s **:wp-mas: Sap**{ .wp } property to **:wp-mas: Flex**{ .wp }.  

**Multiple Mastery on One Weapon**{.inl} When selecting weapons for Weapon Mastery, you can instead **assign an additional _eligible_ Mastery property** to a weapon you already chose. A weapon can have **no more than four** mastery properties at a time. If a weapon has multiple mastery properties, you can **only use one of them per attack**. You must choose which mastery property you're using before making the attack.

<!-- --8<-- [end:wp-mas-ex] -->

## Optional Class Features

You gain class features in the Player's Handbook when you reach certain levels in your class. This section offers additional features that you can gain.

**Replacement**{ .inl } If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one and don't qualify for anything in the game that requires it. 

## Barbarian

### Level 1: Unarmoured Defence (Strength)

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-barb-unarmoured-defence] -->


_Optional Class Feature, Replaces **[Unarmoured Defence]**_

While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armour Class equals **10 + your :abl-str: Strength and :abl-cons: Constitution modifiers**{ .calc }. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

<!-- --8<-- [end:opt-barb-unarmoured-defence] -->

[Unarmoured Defence]: ./barbarian/index.md#level-1-unarmoured-defence

## Ranger

### Level 1: Ranger's Aptitude

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-rng-aptitude] -->

*Optional Class Feature*

You gain invaluable knowledge, experiences, or hard-earned lessons, which is represented by Ranger's Aptidude. You gain one aptidude of your choice. Aptidude are described in the "[Ranger's Aptitude Options]" section later in this class's description.

**Prerequisites**{ .inl } If an aptidude has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that aptidude. For example, if an aptidude requires you to be a level 5+ Ranger, you can select the aptidude once you reach Ranger level 5. If another Ranger feature gives you Aptitude, those Aptitude don't count against the number of Aptitudes you know with this feature.

**Replacing and Gaining Aptidudes**{ .inl } Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of your aptidudes with another one for which you qualify. You can't replace an aptidude if it's a prerequisite for another aptidude that you have.

**Spell**{ .inl } If an aptidude grants a spell, it is considered a Ranger spell for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability.

**Proficiency**{ .inl } If an aptidude grants proficiency in a skill you already have, choose a different proficiency available to the Core Ranger Trait table.

When you gain certain Ranger levels, you gain more aptidudes of your choice, as shown in the Aptidudes column of the Ranger Features table.

You can't pick the same aptidude more than once unless its description says otherwise.

<!-- --8<-- [end:opt-rng-aptitude] -->

## Paladin

### Level 2: Divine Smite

<!-- --8<-- [start:opt-pal-smite] -->

_Optional Class Feature, replaces Paladin's Smite**_

When you damage a creature with a Melee weapon attack or an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } , you can expend a spell slot to cause that attack to deal **bonus damage** to the target. This feature also changes the damage type dealt from _**Radiant Strike**_ feature. This bonus damage is `2d8` for a level 1 spell slot and it increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 1, to a maximum of `6d8`.

The bonus damage of this feature depends on your alignment, or freely choose from the following table.

| Alignment | Damage Type |
|:-:|:-:|
| Good | **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } |
| Neutral | **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } |
| Evil | **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } |
