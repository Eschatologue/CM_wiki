# Illusionist

You focus your study on magic that dazzles the senses and tricks the mind. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions you craft make the impossible seem real. Some Illusionists—including many Gnome Wizards—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

## Level 3: Illusion Savant

Choose two Illusion spells from the Wizard spell list, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one
 
Illusion spell from the Wizard spell list to your spellbook for free.

## Level 3: Improved Minor Illusion

You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.
When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of it.

## Level 6: Malleable Illusions

After you cast an Illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use a Bonus Action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters of the illusion), provided you can see it.

## Level 10: Illusory Self

You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself in response to danger. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your Reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a spell slot of level 2 or higher (no action required).

## Level 14: Illusory Reality

You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi- reality. When you cast an Illusion spell with a spell slot, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn as a Bonus Action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object can't deal damage or give any conditions.
