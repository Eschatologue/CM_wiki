# Technomage

> *Pioneer the Forbidden Frontier*

The rise of Albion as a superpower has ushered in an era of unparalleled innovation and unease across Antares. For millenia, magic is a measurement of a civilisation's achievements, but the emergence of Albion's non-weave based innovation has shaken the status quo, opening a Pandora's box of possibilities and peril.

Technomancy is a controversial school of magic, seeking to fuse Albion's alien technology with the arcane; an act often decreed as a highest-degree of heresy. Practitioners of this art—technomages—are renegades, visionaries, and innovators. They are the ones who dare to dismantle the boundaries of the weave and redefine what magic can achieve.

Each Technomage walks a fine line between discovery and destruction, knowing that their path may either illuminate the future or doom it to chaos.

### Level 3: Advanced "Spellbook"

*The future is now, old man.*

Your spellbook appearance changes into a cutting-edge gadget, replacing traditional pages with a sleek, illuminated interface of shifting glyphs and symbols. 

### Level 3: Out of Spells, not Shells

*To master technomancy, you learn to balance magic and Cordite—a substance that fuels Albion's firearms.*

You gain proficiency with Short-Arms. When you reach level 10 in this class, you gain proficiency with Long-Arms.

### Level 3: Deploy Drone

*You craft a mechanical companion to aid you—though it may not always succeed, it tries its best.*

You craft a mechanical drone, a construct powered by your ingenuity and skill. The drone is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It uses the Drone stat block (provided at the end of this subclass) and your Proficiency Bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the drone's appearance, such as a hovering orb, spider-like walker, flying machine, or another form of your choice.

The drone is friendly to you and your companions. It vanishes if it is destroyed or when you die.

**The Drone in Combat**{.inl} The drone acts during your turn. It can move and use its **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } independently, but the only action it takes is the **:rsc-a: Dodge**{ .rsc } action unless you take a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to command it to take an action from its stat block or another action. If you have the **Incapacitated**{ .cond } condition, the drone acts on its own and its't limited to the **:rsc-a: Dodge**{ .rsc } action.

**Restoring or Replacing the Drone**{.inl} If the drone has been destroyed within the last hour, you can use an action to repair it, expending a level 1+ spell slot. The drone returns to life with all its **:trt-hp: Hit Points** restored after 1 minute.

At the end of a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can construct a new drone, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you already have a drone from this feature, the old one is dismantled when the new one is created.

### Level 6: Upgraded Drone

*Your continued advancements enhance your drone with new capabilities.*

These following features function as long as you and the drone are within a range equal to 50 feet times your Wizard level.

**Media Module**{.inl} While holding your spellbook, you can see and hear through the drone as if you were in its space.

**Spellcasting Module**{.inl} When you cast a Wizard spell on your turn, you can cast it as though you were in the drone's space, using its senses.

### Level 10: Spells Computation

*With the computational power of your spellbook and drone, you've discovered methods to enhance and modify your spells through advanced formulas.*

You can use any of the following options, expending one use of this feature per activation to a maximum number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, regaining all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**:

**Accelerated Ritual**{.inl} You can cast a Wizard spell as a ritual using its normal casting time, rather than adding 10 minutes.

**Improved Potency**{.inl} Choose a level 1 or 2 spell in your spellbook (it needn't to be prepared) with a casting time of an Action. When you cast this spell, it is treated as if cast using a spell slot one level higher.

**Replace Damage**{.inl} When you cast a Wizard spell using a spell slot, you can replace its damage type with a type from another spell in your spellbook. The chosen spell must be of the same level as the slot you expend.

### Level 14: Dual-core Processor

*Your technological mastery allows you to enhance your control systems, enabling more complex operations with your drones.*

**Extra Drone**{.inl} At the end of a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, you can construct and control an additional drone. Both drones act on your turn, sharing the same **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } count and following the same rules as your original drone. You can use the same **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to control both drones.

**Intercept Attack**{.inl} When you are hit by an attack roll, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to command a drone within 60 feet of you to intercept it. The drone immediately moves to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and the attack is redirected to target the drone instead. You avoid all damage and effects associated with the attack.

**Emulate Concentration**{.inl} When you cast a Wizard spell that requires concentration on your turn using the ***Spellcasting Module*** subfeature, you can make the drone concentrate on it instead of you. Though the drone has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on the save it makes to maintain concentration and the spell duration is halved.
