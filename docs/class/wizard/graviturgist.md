# Graviturgist

> *Exert Mastery over the Laws of Attraction*

Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.

### Level 3: Dunamancy Savant

*You studied the natural laws of attraction.*

The spells in Dunamancy Spells Table are added to your class spell list.

### Level 3: Adjust Density

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action, you can alter the weight of one object or creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The object or creature must be Large or smaller. The target's weight is halved or doubled for up to 1 minute or until your Concentration ends (as if you were Concentrating on a spell). Upon reaching level 10 in this class, you can target an object or a creature that is Huge or smaller.

**Halved Weight**{.inl} The creature's Speed increases by 10 feet, it can jump twice as far as normal, and it has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{.d20} on Strength checks and Strength saves.

***Doubled Weight***. The creature's Speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it has **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on Strength checks and Strength saves.

### Level 6: Gravity Well

Whenever you cast a spell on a creature, you can move the target 5 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice if the target is willing to move, the spell hits it with an attack, or it fails a saving throw against the spell.

### Level 10: Violent Attraction

You can manipulate the velocity of creatures and objects.

**Increase Velocity**{.inl} When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you hits with an attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{.rsc} to increase the attack's velocity, causing the attack's target to take an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type.

**Decrease Velocity**{.inl} If a creature within 60 feet of you takes damage from a fall, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{.rsc} to increase the fall's damage by 2d10.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 14: Event Horizon

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action, you can emit a powerful field of gravitational energy that tugs at other creatures for up to 1 minute or until your Concentration ends (as if you were Concentrating on a spell). For the duration, whenever a creature hostile to you starts its turn within 30 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 Force damage, and its Speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage, and every foot it moves this turn costs 2 extra feet of Movement.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest** or until you expend a spell slot of level 3 or higher to use it again.
