# Mech-Accord

> *Control Mechanical Drones*

Unlike most Wizards who focus on a single school of magic, Mech-Accord Wizards specialise in how their spells interact with Albion's technology. Instead of relying solely on magic, they combine spells with machinery, working alongside mechanical constructs called "Drones" to support them.

Interestingly, these wizards donâ€™t come from places where magic is the main focus; rather, they are from regions where magic and technology have been studied side-by-side.
