# Hedge Mage

> *Master the Practical Magic* 

While almost all wizards study in formal schools under the tutelage of a wise master, some wizards reject traditional arcane schooling and ventures arround the world to master magic through experience and ingenuity. These rare few who hone their craft out in the wilds are referred to as Hedge Wizards. Though their methods are frowned upon by formal wizarding schools, any archmage worthy of his station will reluctantly recognize that Hedge Wizards are the true masters of the low magics.

!!! tip "Hedge Wizards"

    Regardless of their origins, all Hedge Wizards shun or outright reject traditional wizardry. When creating your Hedge Wizard, consider how their spellcasting style and spellbook might differ from those of a formally trained wizard. What unique practices, tools, or methods set them apart from their academically taught peers?  

    Note that these differences primarily influence roleplaying and flavour, rather than mechanical gameplay.

### Level 3: Cantrip Savant

*Your unorthodox relationship with arcane magic allows you to you learn fundamental magics not traditionally associated with wizards.*

You learn one cantrip of your choice from any spell list. You learn one additional Cantrips this way as you gain Wizard level; one each at Level 6, 10, and 14.

### Level 3: Self-Taught

*Your deep understanding of the low magics allows you to add them to your spellbook at a discount.* 

The time you must spend to copy any spell of a level equal to half your Proficiency Bonus or lower into your spellbook is halved.

### Level 6: On the Fly

*Your skill with basic magic is second to none, allowing you to spontaneously cast low-level spells that you haven't prepared.* 

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you can cast any spell that is :spell-lv2: level 2 or lower from your spellbook, even if you don't have the spell prepared, expending the appropriate spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of action.

You can cast a spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

As you gain levels in this class, you can cast more powerful spells with this feature: :spell-lv3: level 3 spells at level 10, :spell-lv4: level 4 spells at level 14, and finally :spell-lv5: level 5 spells at level 18.

### Level 10: Hardy Magic

*Learning your magic out in the wild instead of the controlled environment of a formal school has made you hardier than most wizards.*

When you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can use a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to grant yourself a bonus to the result equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1), potentially turning failure into a success.

### Level 14: Arcane Conservation

*Your understanding of arcane fundamentals allows you to recycle the energy of failed spells.*

When you cast a Wizard spell of level 4 or lower and the spell misses, deals no damage, or imposes no effects, you regain one expended spell slot. The regained spell slot must be of a lower level than the slot used to cast the failed spell. This feature applies even if the level 4 spell is cast using a higher-level spell slot.

Starting at Wizard level 18, this ability applies to Wizard spells of level 5 or lower.
