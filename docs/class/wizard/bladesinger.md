# Bladesinger

> *Balance Sword and Spell with the Power of Song - Written by PerfectlyCircularSeal*

Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.

In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.

### Level 3: War and Song

You have Armour Training with Light Armour and you have proficiency in one martial melee weapon that lacks the :weapon-prop-two-handed: Two-Handed property and in the Performance skill. If you already have proficiency in the Performance skill, you gain proficiency in another skill available to Wizards at level 1. 

### Level 3: Bladesong

Using your Bonus Action, you can invoke an elven magic called the *Bladesong*, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armour or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus for 1 minute. It ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition, if you don Medium Armour, Heavy Armour or a Shield, if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon, or if you die. You can also dismiss the *Bladesong* at any time (no action required). While your *Bladesong* is active, you gain the following benefits:

***Keen Defense.*** You gain a bonus to your Armour Class equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

***Increased Speed.*** Your Speed increases by 10 feet.

***Deft Movement.*** You have Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.

***Hyperfocus.*** You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your Concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use your Bladesong a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 6: Extra Attack

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your cantrips that has a casting time of an action. 

### Level 10: Song of Defense

You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active. When you take damage, you can use your Reaction to expend one spell slot and reduce the damage to take by an amount equal to five times the spell slot's level.

### Level 14: Song of Victory

While your Bladesong is active, you can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee attacks.
