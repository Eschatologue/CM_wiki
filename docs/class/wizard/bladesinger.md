# Bladesinger

> *Wield Sword and Magic*

A master of wizardry and swordplay, you combine the elegant manoeuvres of a warrior with the devastating magics of a mage.

Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. In combat, a Bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the Bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a Bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade. 

### Level 3: Bladesong

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you invoke an elven magic called the *Bladesong*, provided you aren’t wearing Armour or using a Shield.

The *Bladesong* lasts for 1 minute and ends early if you have the **Incapacitated**{ .cond } condition, if you don armor or a Shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can dismiss the *Bladesong* at any time (no action required). 

While the *Bladesong* is active, you gain the following benefits. You can invoke the *Bladesong* a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. 
 
**Agility**{ .inl } You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1), and your **:rsc-spd: Speed** increases by 10 feet. 
 
**Bladework**{ .inl } Whenever you attack with a weapon with which you have proficiency, you can use your Intelligence modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity. 

**Focus**{ .inl } When you make a **:d20-save: Constitution saving throw**{ .d20 } to maintain **:spell-conc: Concentration**, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the total. 

### Level 3: Training in War and Song

You gain proficiency with all Melee Martial weapons that don’t have the **:wp-prop-two-handed: Two-Handed**{.wp} or **:wp-prop-heavy: Heavy**{.wp} property. You can use a Melee weapon with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells. 
 
You also gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Athletics, Performance, or Persuasion

### Level 6: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action on your turn.

In addition, you can cast one of Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action in place of one of those attacks.

### Level 10: Song of Defence

When you take damage while your *Bladesong* is active, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to expend one spell slot and reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to five times the spell slot’s level. 

### Level 14: Song of Victory

After you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can make one attack with a weapon as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }.
