# Warrior of Mercy

> *Manipulate Forces of Life and Death*

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These monks are wandering physicians but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as facelless bringgers of life and death.

### Level 3: Hand of Harm

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } and deal damage, you can expend **1 :class-phb24-monk: Focus Point(s)** to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts Die plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 3: Hand of Healing

As a MAgic action, you can expend **1 :class-phb24-monk: Focus Point(s)** to touch a creature and restore a number of Hit Points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 3: Implements of Mercy

You gain proficiency in the Insight and Medicine skill and proficiency with Herbalism Kit.

### Level 6: Physician Touch

Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve as detailed below:

**Hand of Healing**{ .inl } When you use Hand of Healing on a creature, you can also end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the creature: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned.

**Hand of Harm**{ .inl } When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can subject that creature to the Poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.

### Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm

When you use Flurry of Blows, you can now replace each of the **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } with a use of your Hand of Healing, without spending **:class-phb24-monk: Focus Point(s)** for the healing.

In addition, when you make an **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc } with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without spending the **:class-phb24-monk: Focus Point(s)** for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifie (minimum of once). You regain all expended use when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 **:class-phb24-monk: Focus Point(s)**. The creature then returns to life, regaining a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died while subject to any of the following conditions, it revives with them removed: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, or Stunned.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
