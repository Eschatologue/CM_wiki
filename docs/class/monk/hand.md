# Monk: Warrior of the Hand

Warriors of the Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.

## Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:

- **Addle.** The target can't make Opportunity Attacks until the start of its next turn.
- **Push.** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you push it up to 15 feet away from yourself.
- **Topple.** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Prone condition.

## Level 6: Wholeness Of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 11: Fleet Step

You can easily stride out of harm's way. When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind as part of that Bonus Action.
 
## Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can spend 4 Discipline Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with this action. To use this action, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
