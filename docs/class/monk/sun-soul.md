# Warrior of the Sun Soul

> *Blast Foes from a Distance with Radiant Energy*

Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into searing bolts of light. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.

### Level 3: Radiant Sun Bolt

Whenever you make an [Unarmed Strike (Damage)](../../gameplay/phb/action.md#damage), you can make a ranged attack roll as you shoot a bolt of radiant energy from your fists, instead of the normal strike. When you do, the strike deals :dmg-radi: Radiant damage instead of the normal damage type, and the attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Being within 5 feet of an enemy does not impose Disadvantage on this attack.

### Level 6: Blinding Light

When you use your [Patient Defense](index.md#patient-defense) feature, you can expend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to create a bright, flashing light. Choose a number of creatures that you can see within 10 feet of you equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 creature). Each creature must succeed on a Constitution save against your Focus save DC or have the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

### Level 11: Searing Radiance

You have gained the ability to create tremendous blasts of radiant energy, flowing directly from your essence. As a Magic action, you can produce the effects of the [:spell-lv3: Fireball] or [:spell-lv3: Lightning Bolt] spells without components or expending a spell slot, with the following alterations:

***Radiant Damage.*** The effects deal :dmg-radi: Radiant damage, instead of the usual damage type.

***Extra Damage.*** You add half your Monk level (rounded down) to the damage roll of the spell.

***Upcasting.*** When you use this feature, you can spend :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to increase the effective level that the spell is cast at, at a rate of 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** per spell level above 3. The maximum effective level you can cast the spell at is equal to 1 + your Monk level divided by 4 (rounded down).

The spells use your Focus save DC. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest, or until you spend 4 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to use it again.

### Level 17: Sun Shield

You become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura. You shed bright light in a 30-foot Emanation and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a Bonus Action.

When you use your [Deflect Attacks](index.md#level-3-deflect-attacks) feature to reduce the damage of an attack made by a creature within the bright light of this feature, the attacker takes Radiant damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 damage). If you spend a :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to redirect the attack, the target of the redirected attack also takes this damage on a failed save, in addition to the normal damage of Deflect Attacks.
