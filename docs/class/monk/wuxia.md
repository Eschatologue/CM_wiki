# Way of the Wuxia

> *Masterfully Mix Weapons with Martial Arts*

While all Monks are able to wield the weapons of their style to great effect, those who follow the Way of Wuxia dedicate their lives to complete mastery over a chosen few weapons. These warriors are known for their extreme focus and are always seeking progressively stronger warriors to challenge and test their skill with their chosen weapons of war.

### Level 3: Wuxia's Artistry 

You gain a set of Calligrapher’s Supplies and a set of Painter’s Supplies. You have proficiency with both of these.

### Level 3: The Study of Iron

Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons.

***Wuxia Weapons.*** Choose one melee weapon and one ranged weapon which can be Simple or Martial weapon that lacks the :weapon-prop-heavy: **Heavy** or :weapon-prop-special: **Special** properties. The Longbow is also a valid choice.  

You have proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it and you can use its **Mastery** property. These weapons are monk weapons for you. When you finish a Long Rest, you can change each of your Wuxia weapons for a different weapon of your choice, following the criteria above. You can choose one more weapon – either melee or ranged – to be a Wuxia weapon for you, following the criteria above, at levels 6, 11 and 17.

You also gain the following benefits:

***Masterful Aim.*** As a Bonus Action you can focus your spirit to increase your accuracy. For the next Wuxia Weapon attack roll you make before the start of your next turn, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8. You can spend 2 Focus Point to instead treat that d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

***Masterful Parry.*** While you are wielding a melee Wuxia Weapon and a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can take a :rsc-reaction: Reaction to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to your Armour Class against that attack. If the Attack misses, you can spend 2 Focus Point to make a melee attack against the creature that attacks you as part of the same Reaction.

### Level 6: One with the Steel

Your focus empowers your Wuxia weapons, granting you the following benefits.

***Deft Strike.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a Wuxia weapon, you can spend 1 Focus Point to deal additional damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die.

***Magic Wuxia Weapons.*** When you attack with a Wuxia weapon, you can choose to deal the weapon’s damage type or Force damage.

***Rapid Strikes.*** When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace your [Unarmed Strike]s with melee Wuxia Weapon attacks

### Level 11: Soul of the Blade

As a Bonus Action, you can touch one of your Wuxia Weapons and infuse it with 1 to 3 Focus Points to reduce the number you need to roll for critical hit an amount equal to the number of Focus Points expended.

For example, if you infused a normal weapon with 3 Focus Point, its attacks would score a critical hit on a roll of 17-20 on the d20.

This bonus is only usable by you and it lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you imbue your Focus Point into another weapon.

### Level 17: Master of Armaments

When you make an attack roll with a Wuxia weapon, you can choose to use your Monk level in place of rolling the d20. If using your Monk level would result in a critical hit for that attack roll, then the attack becomes a critical hit.

Once you use this feature you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use it again.
