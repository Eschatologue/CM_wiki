# Way of the Wuxia

> *Masterfully Mix Weapons with Martial Arts*

While all Monks are able to wield the weapons of their style to great effect, those who follow the Way of Wuxia dedicate their lives to complete mastery over a chosen few weapons. These warriors are known for their extreme focus and are always seeking progressively stronger warriors to challenge and test their skill with their chosen weapons of war.

### Level 3: The Study of Iron

Your special martial arts training leads you to master the use more weapons. Your selection of Monk Weapons is expanded. Simple and Martial melee weapons that lacks the :weapon-prop-heavy: ^^Heavy^^ property and the Longbow is now considered a Monk Weapon for you. You also gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it.

You also gain additional benefits using your Monk Weapons:

***Masterful Aim.*** When you take the Attack action with a Monk Weapon you can imbue your soul into the weapon to increase its accuracy. Until the start of your next turn, you can treat a d20 roll of 7 or lower as 8. **Enhance.** You can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to instead treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as 10.

***Masterful Parry.*** While you are wielding a Melee Monk Weapon and a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can take a :rsc-r: Reaction to add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to your Armour Class against that attack. **Counter.** If the Attack misses, you can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to make a Melee attack against the creature that attacks you as part of the same Reaction.

### Level 3: Wuxia's Artistry 

You gain a set of Calligrapher's Supplies and a set of Painter's Supplies. You have proficiency with both of these.

### Level 6: One with the Steel

Your focus empowers your Monk Weapons, granting you the following benefits.

***Deft Strike.*** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a Monk Weapon, you can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to deal additional damage equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die.

***Magic Monk Weapons.*** When you attack with a Monk Weapon, you can choose to deal the weapon's damage type or :dmg-force: Force damage.

***Rapid Strikes.*** When you use [Flurry of Blows](index.md#flurry-of-blows), you can replace your Unarmed Strike with melee Monk Weapon attacks.

### Level 11: Soul of the Blade

As a :rsc-b: Bonus Action, you can touch one of your Monk Weapons and infuse it with 1 to 3 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to reduce the number you need to roll for critical hit an amount equal to the number of :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** expended. For example, if you infused a normal weapon with 3 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point**, its attacks would score a Critical Hit on a roll of 17-20 on the d20.

This bonus is only usable by you and it lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you imbue your :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** into another Monk Weapon.

### Level 17: Master of the Blade

When you make an attack roll with a Monk Weapon, you can choose to use your Monk level in place of rolling the d20. If using your Monk level would result in a Critical Hit for that attack roll, then the attack becomes a critical hit.

Once you use this feature you must finish a Short or Long Rest before you can use it again.
