# Warrior of Shadow

> *Harness Shadow Power for Stealth and Subterfuge*

Warriors of Shadow practice stealth and subterfuge, channeling their reservoirs of power to harness the power of the Shadowfell. They are at home in darkness, able to draw gloom around themselves to hide, to leap from shadow to shadow, and even to take on a wraithlike form of living shadow.

### Level 3: Shadow Arts

Through rigorous training, you have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits:

**Darkness**{ .inl } You can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to cast the *Darkness* spell without any spell components. You can see within the spell's area when you cast it with this feature. While the spell persists, you can move its area of darkness to a space within 60 feet of you at the start of each of your turns.

**Darkvision**{ .inl } You gain Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet.

**Shadowy Figments**{ .inl } You know the *Minor Illusion* cantrip and use Wisdom as the spellcasting ability for it.

### Level 6: Shadow Step

While entirely within Dim Light or Darkness, you can use a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in Dim Light or Darkness. You then have Advantage on the next melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

### Level 11: Improved Shadow Step

You can draw on your connection to shadow to empower your teleportation. When you use your Shadow Step, you can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to remove the requirement that you must start and end in Dim Light or Darkness for that use of the feature. As part of this Bonus Action, you can make an [Unarmed Strike] immediately after the teleportation.

### Level 17: Cloak Of Shadows

As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action while entirely within Dim Light or Darkness, you can spend 3 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to shroud yourself with magical darkness for 1 minute, until you have the Incapacitated condition, or until you end your turn in Bright Light. While shrouded in darkness, you gain the following benefits:

**Invisibility**{ .inl } You have the Invisible condition.

**Partially Incorporeal**{ .inl } You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.

**Shadow Flurry**{ .inl } You can use your Flurry of Blows without spending any :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points**
