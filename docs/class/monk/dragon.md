# Warrior of the Ascendant Dragon

> *Harness your Inner Draconic Power*  

The fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. But all this power is in service of a greater goal: achieving a spiritual unity with the essence of the Material Plane.

### Level 3: Draconic Disciple

You can channel draconic power to magnify your presence and imbue your unarmed strikes with the essence of a dragon's breath. You gain the following benefits:

***Draconic Presence.*** If you fail an Intimidation or Persuasion check, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to reroll the check and add a roll of your Martial Arts die to the result, as you tap into the mighty presence of dragons. Once this feature turns a failure into a success, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

***Draconic Strike.*** When you make an attack with a Monk weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can change the damage type to :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-lgtn: Lightning, or :dmg-posn: Poison.

***Tongue of Dragons.*** You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic or one other language of your choice.

### Level 3: Breath of the Dragon

*You can channel destructive waves of energy, like those created by the dragons.*

When you make a melee attack or Unarmed Strike, you can replace one of the attacks with an exhalation of draconic energy in either a **20 ft. :aoe-cone: Cone** or a **30 ft. by 5 ft. :aoe-line: Line** (your choice). Choose a damage type: :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-lgtn: Lightning, or :dmg-posn: Poison. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity save against your Focus save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts plus your Wisdom modifier die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At level 11, the damage of this feature increases to three rolls of your Martial Arts die.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**. Alternatively, you can spend 2 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to regain one use this feature (no action required).

### Level 6: Wings Unfurled

When you use your Step of the Wind, you can unfurl spectral draconic wings from your back that vanish at the end of your turn. While the wings exist, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.

### Level 11: Aspect of the Wyrm

*The power of your draconic spirit now radiates from you, warding your allies or inspiring fear in your enemies.* 

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can create an Emanation of draconic power that radiates 10 feet from you for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain one of the following effects of your choice:

***Frightful Presence.*** When you create the Emanation and as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on subsequent turns, you can choose a creature within the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Wisdom save against your Focus save DC or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

***Resistance***. Choose a damage type when you activate the Emanation: :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-lgtn: Lightning, or :dmg-posn: Poison. You and your allies within the Emanation have **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } to that damage type.

Once you create the Emanation, you can't create it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**, unless you expend 3 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Points** to create it again.

### Level 17: Ascendant Aspect

Your draconic spirit reaches its peak. You gain the following benefits:

***Augment Breath.*** When you use your Breath of the Dragon, you can spend 1 :class-phb24-monk: **Focus Point** to augment its shape and power. The exhalation of draconic energy becomes either a 60 ft. :aoe-cone: Cone or a 90 ft. by 5 ft. :aoe-line: Line (your choice), and each creature in that area takes damage equal to four rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Blindsight.*** You have Blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

***Explosive Fury.*** When you activate your Aspect of the Wyrm, draconic fury explodes from you. Choose any number of creatures you can see in your Emanation. Each of those creatures must succeed on a Dexterity save against your Focus save DC or take 3d10 :dmg-acid: Acid, :dmg-cold: Cold, :dmg-fire: Fire, :dmg-lgtn: Lightning, or :dmg-posn: Poison damage (your choice).
