# Way of the Wu Jen

*Channel the Primal Power of the Elements*

Rather than focus inward, some Monks attune themselves to the forces of nature. Known as Wu Jens, these primal sages augment their skills with the power of the five elements; Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and Wood. Through meditation, they can learn to channel their Ki into amazing displays of elemental prowess.

### Level 3: Disciple of the Elements

You learn ancient monastic arts that allow you to cast spells

#### Cantrips 

You know the *Elementalism* cantrip and two cantrips of your choice from the Wu Jen spell list at the end of this subclass description. You learn one additional Wu Jen cantrip when you reach Monk level 10 and 17.

#### Spell Slots

The Wu Jen Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Wu Jen spells of levels 1–4. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Wu Jen spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

#### Ki Casting

You can draw upon your Ki to regain your elemental powers. As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can expend a number of Focus Points equal to your Spell Slot Level to regain one of your expended Wu Jen spell slots.

#### Prepared Spells of Level 1+

You prepare a list of spells of level 1 and higher that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spell from the [Wu Jen spell list](../../spells/class-specific/wu-jen.md).

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wu Jen Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wu Jen spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 7, for example, you learn a new Wu Jen spell, which can be of levels 1–2.

#### Changing your Prepared Spells

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice from the Wu Jen spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Wu Jen spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus

Your body becomes the spellcasting focus for Wu Jen spells, and you don't need to provide any Material components for Wu Jen spells.

### Level 6: Infusion of the Elements

When you take the Attack action to attack with a Monk Weapon or an [Unarmed Strike], you can replace one of your attack and imbue the magic of one Wu Jen cantrip you know into your attack. The cantrip you choose must have the following prerequisite:

- The Wu Jen cantrip has a casting time of an Action.
- The Wu Jen cantrip has a single attack roll or force its target to make a Saving Throw.

When you do, your reach for that attack increases by 5 feet, and on hit, it deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip additional effects on hit, except for damage. The cantrip itself does not deal damage.

When you hit your target with an attack using this feature, you can spend 1 Focus Point to choose one of the following effects:

***Forced Movement.*** You can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.

***Teleport.*** You instantly teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of your target.

### Level 11: Spiritual Flow

You weave your martial arts with spiritual magic. When you cast a Wu Jen spell with a casting time of an Action, you can expend 2 Focus Points to cast it as a Bonus Action instead. 

Moreover, when you start your turn and are Concentrating on a spell that you cast on yourself (such as *Haste*), you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to twice the level of that spell.

### Level 15: Ancension of the Elements

As a Bonus Action, you can draw all five elements into yourself to take on an Elemental Form. You gain the following benefits:

***Fly Speed.*** You gain Fly Speed equals to your Speed.

***Rapid Strikes.*** When you attack with a Monk Weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can make two additional Monk Weapon or Unarmed Strikes attacks as part of that attack action (for a total of four attacks).

***Temporary Hit Points.*** Whenever you cast a Wu Jen spell you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

***Forced Teleportation.*** Whenever you teleport with a Wu Jen feature or spell, you can touch a creature equal to you in size (or smaller) and teleport it with you (no action required). This includes grappled creatures.

Your Elemental Form lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you have the Incapacitated condition or when you choose to end it (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending 6 Focus Points (no action required).
