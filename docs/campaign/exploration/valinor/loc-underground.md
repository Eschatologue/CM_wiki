# Valinor: Underground

*Being engulfed in an eternal snowstorm has made further expansion into the frozen wastes impossible for the academic city. Combined with the limited range and resources needed to sustain the Irminsul generator, expansion underground became the more practical choice.*  

*Fortunately for the elves, a vast underground cavern lies just beneath the surface, formed in the aftermath of the Second Maelstrom half a millennia ago.*  

*Above, the enlightened—the scholars and thinkers—bask in the comforts of the surface. Below, the workers, the commoners, and even the engineers toil in the depths, ensuring the city's survival while seldom glimpsing the sky.*
