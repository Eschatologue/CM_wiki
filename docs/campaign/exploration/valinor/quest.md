# Quest

Everyone has to start somewhere. While others are too focused to their side-jobs. Eitherway, the more dangerous the job, the bigger the ~~pain~~ pay.

## Valinor: Retaking the Surface

What remains of the Valinor's resistance has been pushed to this decrepit part of the Underground. The goals seems clear, but knowing your adventure so far, not everything is black and white.

- [x] Explore the Abandoned Crossbow Factory
- [x] Ask *Lahti* about your next assignment, if any.
- [ ] Go to the Bandit's hold out and take them out.
- TBA

## The Need, For Speed

You somehow got yourself an Albion's vehicle known as a "Car". Its barely working though. You're sure this belongs to someone, but finder's keepers.
