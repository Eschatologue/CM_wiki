> *"Ambitious, arrogant, and seemingly all-knowing, much like the number zero. It's the void from which all other thing begin.”*

# Parable of the Stars

*Seven Spires with seven Ascent, each represents a concept and in some ways a purpose, and those who follows a specific Ascent can draw powers from it. The spires are beings of higher power, some can say they even trancends the concept of God that we once has.* 

*You, child of the star are chosen with the purpose to reveal the secrets behind the Spires and their influences upon this world, will you bring this forsaken world salvation it needs or the destruction it deserves?*

## Cosmic Weave <span style="float:right;"> <small> Level 2 </small> </span>

Your connection with the cosmic energies grants you access to some spells when you reach a certain level in this class, as shown on your class Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
