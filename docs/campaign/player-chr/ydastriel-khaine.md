> *"Ambitious, arrogant, and seemingly all-knowing, much like the number zero. It's the void from which all other thing begin.”*

# Parable of the Stars

*Seven Spires with seven Ascent, each represents a concept and in some ways a purpose, and those who follows a specific Ascent can draw powers from it. The spires are beings of higher power, some can say they even trancends the concept of God that we once has.* 

*You, child of the star are chosen with the purpose to reveal the secrets behind the Spires and their influences upon this world, will you bring this forsaken world salvation it needs or the destruction it deserves?*

## 2nd Level: Cosmic Weave

Your connection with the cosmic energies grants you access to some spells when you reach a certain level in this class, as shown on your class Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

## 3rd Level: Spire's Resonance

Your growing understanding of the Spires and their role in Antares has granted you the ability to draw powers from the ascents they represent.

Upon gaining this class feature, you gain additional Starry Forms tied to specific ascent. You can replace your original Starry Form with the following options, but you can't have more than three at one time. You can choose which form to have after you finish a long rest.

### Circle of Stars Forms

=== "**Archer**"

    *A constellation of an archer appears on you.*

    **Luminous Bow:** When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. (2d8 at 10th-level).

    **Arrow of Arbiters:** Your Star Map transform into a longbow and you can you use it to cast Cosmic Flare, when you do, it ignores half and three-quarters cover and deals Radiant damage.

=== "**Chalice**"

    *A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you.* 

    **Chalice of Life:** Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. (2d8 at 10th-level)

    **Rejuvinating Bolt:** When you hit a creature with Cosmic Flare you can choose to restore hit points to that creature instead of damaging it. The restored hit points is equal to your Cosmic Flare damage.

=== "**Dragon**"

    *A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you.* 

    **Wise:** When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10. At 10th-level, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

    **Repelling:** When you hit a creature that is no more that one size larger than you with Cosmic Flare, you can push the creature up to 5 feet away from you in a straight line.

### Spire Resonance Forms

=== "**Destruction**"

    *One of your eyes ignites with a searing white blaze while a small, flaming white sphere materializes and orbits you, leaving behind a delicate trail of white. Your being pulsates with an overwhelming intent for destruction.*

    **Destructive Flare:** Your Cosmic Flare now crackles with instabilities, pulsating with radiant white glows. When you hit a target with your *Cosmic Flare*, each creature within 5 feet of your target takes Force damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.(1)
    { .annotate }
    
    1. This feature does not benefit from ***Helium Flash***, your initial target still take the extra :material-dice-d8: d8 damage, but the surrounding targets only takes damage from only your Wisdom modifier.

    **Helium Flash:** When you cast a druid spell, roll a :material-dice-d8: d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.(1)
    { .annotate }
    
    1. This extra :material-dice-d8: d8 only affect ONE of the spell's damage roll. e.g, If you cast *Cosmic Flare* at 5th-level, you only add one :material-dice-d8: d8 to one of the projectiles.
