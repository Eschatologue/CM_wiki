# The Void-Touched

**Base Sublass:** *[Samurai](../../class/fighter/samurai.md)*

The blood of an *Andskotarnir*—both a demon and aberration—flows through your veins. To the aberrations, you are a traitor; to mortals, a threat. Your very existence blurs the line between realities, and the whispers of the Void, which would shatter lesser minds, only sharpen your resolve.  

But the Void is not easily tamed. Its influence lingers, patient and insidious. The power it grants you comes at a price: a mind constantly on the precipice of comprehension and corruption. You are both hunter and hunted, forever dancing with the darkness that made you.  

Will you master the Void, or will it master you?  

### Level 3: Blitzing Strike

*Your connection to the Void allows you to exploit Antares' inherent spatial anomalies.*

When you attack as part of the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, you can Teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can choose to Teleport either before or after the attack. You can only teleport once per attack. 

### Level 3: Extraplanar Hunter

The number you need to roll for a Critical Hit against Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, and Fiend is reduced by **1**{ title="Critical Hit on 19-20" } for attack rolls with weapons or **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }. This effect can stack with other sources of Critical Hit reduction. This number increases at level 7 (**2**{ title="Critical Hit on 18-20" }), and again at level 15 (**3**{ title="Critical Hit on 17-20" }).

### Level 7: Void Adept

Your ability to conjure spatial anomalies is improved, detailed below.

**Teleportation**{ .inl } When you deal damage to a target with your Fighting Spirit, you can force the target to make a **:d20-save: CHA Save**{ .d20 } (`DC = 8 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency Bonus`). On a failed save, you Teleport the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

**Spatial Jump**{ .inl } As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you can bend space arround you and Teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can't do so again until you finish a **:rest-short: Short** or **:rest-long: Long Rest**, unless you spend 1 use of your Fighting Spirit.
