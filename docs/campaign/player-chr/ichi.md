### Level 3: Flow State

After you use ^^Fighting Spirit^^, you enter a state of heightened focus. This Flow State last for 1 minute and ends early if you becomes Incapacitated. This state will act as a condition for which you can use the features you gain for this gimmick.

While you are within ^^Flow State^^ and wielding a weapon with :weapon-prop-versatile: **Versatile** property, and a creature you can see hits you with a melee attack, you can use your **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to give yourself a bonus to your AC equal to your Proficiency Bonus. Should this cause the attack to miss, you can make one melee weapon attack against your attacker as part of the same **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc }.
