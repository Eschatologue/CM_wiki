# The Void-Touched

**Base Sublass:** *[Samurai](../../class/fighter/samurai.md)*

The blood of an *Andskotarnir*—both a demon and aberration—flows through your veins. To the aberrations, you are a traitor; to mortals, a threat. Your very existence blurs the line between realities, and the whispers of the Void, which would shatter lesser minds, only sharpen your resolve.  

But the Void is not easily tamed. Its influence lingers, patient and insidious. The power it grants you comes at a price: a mind constantly on the precipice of comprehension and corruption. You are both hunter and hunted, forever dancing with the darkness that made you.  

Will you master the Void, or will it master you?  

### Level 3: Blitzing Strike

Your connection to the Void allows you to manifest spatial anomalies. When you take the **:rsc-a: Attack**{ .rsc } action, you can Teleport up to a distance equals to **five times your Proficiency Bonus**{ title="Level 1-4: <code>10 feet</code><br>Level 5-8: <code>15 feet</code><br>Level 9-12: <code>20 feet</code><br>Level 13-16: <code>25 feet</code><br>Level 17+: <code>30 feet</code>" } to an unoccupied space you can see before each attack. 

### Level 3: Extraplanar Hunter

The number you need to roll for a Critical Hit against Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, and Fiend is reduced by **1**{ title="Critical Hit on 19-20" } for attack rolls with weapons or **:rsc-a: Unarmed Strike**{ .rsc }. This effect can stack with other sources of Critical Hit reduction. This number increases at level 7 (**2**{ title="Critical Hit on 18-20" }), and again at level 15 (**3**{ title="Critical Hit on 17-20" }).
