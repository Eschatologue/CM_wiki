# Sorcerous Origin: Spellbreaker

*"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your power doesn't stem from weaving spells, but from binding and severing them—a Spellbreaker.*

> "He's a man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage."
## Level 1: Bonus Proficiencies 

You gain Proficiency in Intelligence (Arcana) if you don’t already have it. Moreover, you can add your Charisma modifier to an Intelligence (Arcana) check to recall lore about spells, magic items, or magic symbolism related to your nation. 

## Level 1: Clairvoyance 

*You calm yourself down and enter a state of heightened focus, allowing you to sense the weaves of magic that permeate this world.*

As an :rsc-action: **Action**, you can focus your mind and awaken your senses to see the presence of magic(1) within 60 feet of you for 10 minutes, that is not behind full cover.

When you sense magic in this way, as an :rsc-action: **Action**, you can focus your mind to one object or one creature to learn the following:

- If you focus on an object, you instantly learn the school (or schools) of magic that was used to enchant it, if any.
- If you focus on a creature, you learn its spellcasting ability, if any, and the level of the highest level spell it can cast.

If the object or creature is hidden from Divination magic, such as a *nondetection* spell, it appears as if it is mundane or it cannot cast spells.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, you regain one expended use on a Short Rest and all expended use on a Long Rest. When you have no use remaining, you can expend a spell slot and regain a number of use equal to the slot amount expended.

## Level 3: Spellcasting

The weave of magic courses through you, yet you've never bothered to learn how to cast spells or study them. With the cost of teachers being quite high nowadays, you've forged your own path instead of adhering to your nation's tradition. While it may be seen as an insult to the old ways, your methods are just as, if not more, effective.

## Level 3: Dekrat's Special:material-trademark:

*You've learned how to break the normal rules and conventions of casting spells, bending them to your will and channeling them through your weapon strikes*

Once per turn when you make an attack that adds your Sneak Attack damage, you can simultaneously cast a spell to be channeled through it.

To be channeled this way, the spell must met the following requirements:

- The Sorcerer spell must have a casting time of an :rsc-action: **Action**.
- The Sorcerer spell must require only a single spell :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** or force its target to make a :d20-save: **Saving Throw**.

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately in addition of the normal effects and damage from your weapon attack, under the rules below:

- :aoe-rad: **Area of Effects.** If the spell targets an area greater than a 10 ft. :aoe-cube: cube, it takes effect as a 15 ft. :aoe-cone: cone originating from you, which must include your target. Alternatively, it can be contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice). Using a ranged weapon, your spell is contained to only affect the target of your attack.

- :spell-level-0: **Cantrip.** The cantrip ^^does not deal damage^^. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip additional effects on hit, except for damage.

- :spell-concentration: **Concentration.** If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.

- :d20-save: **Saving Throws.** If the spell requires a :d20-save: **Saving Throw** when cast, the target makes the first **Save** at a :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on hit. If you score a Critical Hit on the attack, the target automatically fails its :d20-save: **Saving Throw**. Other target (if any) make this **Save** as normal.

- :d20-attack: **Spell Attacks.** If the spell requires a spell :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**, it instantly take effect when you hit with a weapon attack.

You learn the [Hunter's Mark](../../../spells/1st-level.md#hunters-mark) spell. You can expend one use of your Clairvoyance to cast this spell without expending any spell slots as if it is a level 1 spell. For you this spell does not require concentration, but the spell's duration remains.

Moroever, you gain additional benefits against your Quarry:

- You learn your Quarry spellcasting ability (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), if any, and the level of the highest level spell it can cast.
- Your Quarry has :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on Concentration Checks against your attacks.
- You gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack: You can add your Sneak Attack damage the damage roll on your weapon attack against your Quarry as long as you don't have :d20-disadv: **Disadvantage** on the attack. 

## Level 5: The People’s Eyebrow

*With a simple raise of your eyebrow, you possess the uncanny ability to disrupt and foil a spellcaster's magic.*

When you see a creature casting a spell or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use a :rsc-reaction: **Reaction** to expend a :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** to try magically foils it.

If the spell was cast at a level equal to the level of the :rsc-spell-slot: **Spell Slot** you expended or lower, the spell fails and has no effect. If it was cast at a level higher than the slot you expended, make a :ability-cha: Charisma :d20-check: **Ability Check** against DC of 10 + the level of the spell, the spell fails and has no effect when you succeed the check.

## Level 9: Dispel and Beguile

*Your tounge carry traces of abjuration magic, distrupting the magic of those you charm.*

When you use *Panache* against a creature that is under the effects of a spell (e.g *Haste* or *Stoneskin*), or when it is :spell-concentration: **Concentrating** on a spell, you can expend a spell slot to attempt to dispel that spell or break its concentration. If the spell you attempt to dispel or the spell the creature concentrating in was cast at a level equal to the level of spell slot you expended or lower, the spell ends or its concentration is broken. 

If the spell was cast at a level higher than the spell slot you expend and your initial *Panache* ability check results exceeds 10 + the level of the spell, the spell ends or its :spell-concentration: **Concentration** broken.
