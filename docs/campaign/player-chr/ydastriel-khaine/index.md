# Parable of the Stars

*Seven Spires with seven Ascent, each represents a concept and in some ways a purpose, and those who follows a specific Ascent can draw powers from it. The spires are beings of higher power, some can say they even trancends the concept of God that we once has.* 

*You, child of the star are chosen with the purpose to reveal the secrets behind the Spires and their influences upon this world, will you bring this forsaken world salvation it needs or the destruction it deserves?*

> "Ambitious, arrogant, and seemingly all-knowing, much like the number zero. It's the void from which all other thing begin.”

### Level 2: Bonus Cantrip

You gain to unleash the power which Spires draws from. You learn the *Cosmic Flare* cantrip, it counts as Druid cantrip for you and it doesn't count against the number of Druid cantrips you know.

While holding your Star Map, you can add your Wisdom modifier to this cantrip's damage roll.

### Level 3: Spire's Resonance

Your growing understanding of the Spires and their role in Antares has granted you the ability to draw powers from the ascents they represent.

When you enter your Starry Form, you can enhance its abilities by choosing one of the following Resonances. Each Resonance boosts a specific aspect of your Starry Form.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses after a Long Rest. Alternatively, you can regain all expended uses by expending one use of Wild Shape (no action required).

:   ***Searing Flare (Chalice Form).*** Once per turn, when you restore Hit Points to a creature using the Chalice Form feature, all creatures within 5 feet of the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take Radiant damage equals to the Chalice Form's healing roll.

At Druid level 6, whenever you take this Magic action on your turn, you can attack twice, instead of once.
