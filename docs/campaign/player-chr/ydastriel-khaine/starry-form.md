# Khaine's Starry Form

## Crown & Misery Starry Form

---

### Destruction

*One of your eyes ignites with a searing white blaze while a small, flaming white sphere materializes and orbits you, leaving behind a delicate trail of white. Your being pulsates with an overwhelming intent for destruction.*

**Destructive Flare**  
Your **Starry Wisp** now crackles with instabilities, pulsating with radiant white glows. When you hit a target with the spell, you can force all creature within 5 feet of it to make a :d20-save: Constitution saving throw. On failed save, they take damage as if they had also been hit by this cantrip.

**Helium Flash**  
When you cast a Druid spell, roll a :die-d8: d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled. This increases to :die-d10: d10 at Druid level 10.

### Perseverance

*A radiant halo manifests on your back while one of your eyes emits a dazzling amber light. Portions of your skin are adorned with steel, fortifying your resolve and strengthening your presence.*
 
**Immolation**  
Your **Starry Wisp** now deals :dmg-fire: Fire damage and its damage die becomes a :die-d10: **1d10**. This increases to :die-d12: **d12** at Druid level 10.

**Aura of Tenacity**  
So long you don't have the Incapacitated condition, any ally who starts their turn within 5 feet of you gains Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level until the start of your next turn. At Druid level 10, ally gains Temporary Hit Points when they start their turn 15 feet from you.

### Judgement

*Shining armour of crimson plates form all over you, transforming you into the executor of justice. Those who obstruct Judgement shall be stricken down with impunity.*

**Fist of Conviction**  
As a Magic action, you can make a melee spell attack with the range of 5 feet that deals :dmg-radiant: Radiant damage to 1d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. When you reach Druid level 6, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take this Magic action on your turn.

**Leviathan Queller**  
Armour constructed from cosmic energies materialise on you, enpowering you to mete out judgement upon the guilty. So long as you are not wearing Medium or Heavy armour, or wielding a shield, you have the following benefits:

- Your Walking Speed increases by 10 feet.
- You gain a bonus to your Armour Class equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).
- You gain a bonus to Concentration Check equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).

### Enlightenment

*Radiant laurel wreath materializes, hovering above your head, while your eyes shimmer with a vibrant yellow hue, signaling the unveiling of truth.*

**Signum Ignorantiae**  
Your **Starry Wisp** now deals :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage, on hit the creature is :material-crosshairs-gps: **Marked** by you.

**Bastio Veritatis**  
When a :material-crosshairs-gps: **Marked** creature that you can see is hit by an attack from your ally, you can take a :rsc-reaction: Reaction to cast **Guiding Bolt** against it. When you do, add your spellcasting modifier to the spell Damage Roll and its damage type becomes :dmg-psychic: Psychic damage.

### Prosperity

*A figure of the Avatar of Wealth appears behind you, your fingertips shimmering with gold and silver. You perceive the worth and value of all objects within your vision.*

**Investment Liquidation**  
You have the ability take a :rsc-reaction: Reaction to destroy an amount of SP on your person to enhance an attack, increases healing, or damage reduction, defined as follow:

:   ***Efficiency Investment.*** When you or a friendly creature you can see hits with an attack, you can increase the damage dealt by :die-d10: **1d10** for every 1,000 SP you destroy.

:   ***Health Insurance.*** When you or a friendly creature you can see is targeted by a spell or effect that restores Hit Points or grants temporary Hit Points, you can increase the total Hit Points or the number of temporary Hit Points gained by :die-d10: **1d10** for every 1,000 SP you destroy.

:   ***Damage Reimbursement.*** When you or a friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can reduce the damage received by :die-d10: **1d10** for every 1,000 SP you destroy.

### Equillibrium

*Multiple flat, semi-transparent blue tablets materialize, displaying cryptic combinations of numbers, letters, and figures, hovering before you. One of your eyes radiates a blue hue, granting you the power to decipher the scripts that foretell fortunes.*

**Restore Balance**  
When a creature you can see within 60 feet makes a D20 Test with an :d20-adv: Advantage or :d20-disadv: Disadvantage, you can take a :rsc-reaction: Reaction to cast **Starry Wisp** at it. On hit, it nullifies all instance of :d20-adv: Advantage or :d20-disadv: Disadvantage it has for that D20 Test.
