# Dekrat's Anti-Spellcasting Measures:material-trademark:

**Base Sublass:** *[Swashbuckler](../../class/rogue/swashbuckler.md)*

> *A man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage.*

"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your way of weaving spells are quite different from your peers; you combine the power of spells, excessive guile, and the right amount of audacity.


### Level 3: Arcane Knowledge 

*Not knowing much about magic, whatever you believe in is considered facts for you.*

Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion. You gain proficiency with that skill and can use your Charisma instead of Intelligence for ability checks with the chosen skill. You can change the chosen skill when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 3: Dekrat's Special:material-trademark:

*You've learned how to break the normal rules and conventions of casting spells, bending them to your will and channeling them through your weapon strikes*

Once per turn when you hit an attack that adds your **:class-phb24-rogue: Sneak Attack**{ .em } damage, you can cast a spell to be channeled through it.

To be channeled this way, the spell must met the following requirements:

- The Dekrat's spell must have a casting time of an **:rsc-a: Action**{ .rsc }.
- The Dekrat's spell must require only a single spell *attack roll* or force its target to make a *saving throw*.

The spell takes effect immediately in addition of the normal effects and damage from your weapon attack, under the rules below:

**:aoe-rad: Area of Effect**{ .inl } If the spell targets an area greater than a **10-foot :aoe-cube: Cube**, it takes effect as a **15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone** originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice on hit). Using a ranged weapon, your spell is contained to only affect the target of your attack.
{ .indt }

**:spell-lv0: Cantrips**{ .inl } The Cantrip does not deal damage. Instead, your weapon attack deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip's additional effects, other than damage, on hit.
{ .indt }

**:spell-conc: Concentration**{ .inl } If the spell requires your :spell-conc: Concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.
{ .indt }

**:d20-save: Saving Throw**{ .inl } If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the first save at a **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{ .d20 } on hit. On a Critical Hit, the target automatically fails the save. Other target (if any) make this save as normal.
{ .indt }

**:d20-attack: Attack Roll**{ .inl } If the spell requires an attack roll, it instantly take effect when you hit with a weapon attack.
{ .indt }

### Level 3: Dekrat's Spells:material-trademark:

The weave of magic courses through you, yet you've never bothered to learn how to cast spells or study them. With the cost of teachers being quite high nowadays, you've forged your own path instead of adhering to your nation's tradition. While it may be seen as an insult to the old ways, your methods are just as, if not more, effective.

### Level 3: Spellbreaker's Mark

When you roll for **:d20-inv: Initiative**{.d20 } or as **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } on your subsequent turn, you can place a **Spellbreaker's Mark** on a creature you can see. This Mark lasts until you use this feature on another creature or the target dies.
