# Character's Gimmick

Gimmicks are linked to the progression of the story. Typically, players will automatically acquire a gimmick as the narrative unfolds. However, there are potential avenues to expedite this process, subject to the Dungeon Master's discretion. These are associated with delving into your character's personal history and exploring their past experiences.
