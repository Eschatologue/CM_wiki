# Path of the Finality

**Base Barbarian Subclass:** *[Wildheart](../../class/barbarian/wild-heart.md)*

You stand as the last remnant of a lineage that has long perished—a relic from an old world, the descendants of those erased from history. As this world approaches its end, your story is just beginning. Questions beg answers, and loose ends yearn to be tied.

Your name, your family, and your tribe all converge at a singular point in history—a history the Spires played a part in erasing. What secrets lie beyond the stars? What mysteries rest beneath this continent? And what awaits at the journey's end?

> *“May your blade be swift, your judgment just, and your decisions resolute.”*

### Level 3: Smite of Origin

*You gain the ability to channel the lethal repercussion of speaking Celestial.* 

Whenever you hit a target with a Strength-based attack, you can utter a word in Celestial and deal extra **2d6 :dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } damage. This extra damage increases by `1d6` when you reach level 6 (`3d6`), 10 (`4d6`), 14 (`5d6`), and 20 (`6d6`). 

You can use this feature a number of times equal to **twice your Proficiency Bonus**. If you use this feature again while having no uses remaining, you immediately take **:dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } damage. The damage increases each time you exceed the limit: `1d12` for the first, `2d12` for the second, and so on. This damage ignores **:dmg-res: Resistance**{ .em } and **:dmg-imm: Immunity**{ .em }.

You regain two expended use when you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 3: Primordial Strike

*Your smites taps into the mythical power of animals that exists in legends.*

When you use *Smite of Origin* while your **:ui-rage: Rage** is active, you can make it cause an additional effect that depends on the option you choose for your *Rage of the Wilds* feature. The effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt.

**Healing Smite**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Bear_
:   Your smite cauterise wounds. One creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet gain **:trt-hp: Hit Points** equals twice your Proficiency Bonus.

**Tailwind Smite**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Eagle_
:   Your smite grants swiftness. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet has their **:rsc-spd: Speed** increased by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

**Marking Smite**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Wolf_
