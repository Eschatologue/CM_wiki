# Path of the Finality

**Base Class:** *[Barbarian](../../class/barbarian/index.md)*

You stand as the last remnant of a lineage that has long perished—a relic from an old world, the descendants of those erased from history. As this world approaches its end, your story is just beginning. Questions beg answers, and loose ends yearn to be tied.

Your name, your family, and your tribe all converge at a singular point in history—a history the Spires played a part in erasing. What secrets lie beyond the stars? What mysteries rest beneath this continent? And what awaits at the journey's end?

> *“May your blade be swift, your judgment just, and your decisions resolute.”*

### Level 1: The Joy of Fishing

Memories from somewhere beyond *somehow* gives you Proficiency with [Fishing Supplies](../../equipment/tools/other-tools.md#fishings-supplies) if you don't already have it. Moreover, when you don't have Fishing Supplies, you can spend 1 hour and 150 SP worth of material to create one. This can be done as part of a Short Rest.

### Level 3: Heaven's Maledict

You gain the ability to channel the lethal repercussion of speaking Celestial to your own benefit. This power is represented by your Maledict Dice, which fuel powers you have from these special features. Heaven's Maledict Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Barbarian levels.
