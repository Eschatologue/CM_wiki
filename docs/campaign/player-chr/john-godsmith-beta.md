# Path of the Finality

**Base Subclass:** *[Barbarian](../../class/barbarian/wild-heart.md)*

You stand as the last remnant of a lineage that has long perished—a relic from an old world, the descendants of those erased from history. As this world approaches its end, your story is just beginning. Questions beg answers, and loose ends yearn to be tied.

Your name, your family, and your tribe all converge at a singular point in history—a history the Spires played a part in erasing. What secrets lie beyond the stars? What mysteries rest beneath this continent? And what awaits at the journey's end?

> *“May your blade be swift, your judgment just, and your decisions resolute.”*

### Level 3: Heaven's Maledict

Whenever you activate your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } or as a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc } thereafter, you can utter a Celestial word and channel its lethal repercussion. You immediately take **1d12 :dmg-necr: Necrotic**{ .dmg-necr } damage and gain one of the following benefit while your **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em } is active:

**Rage of the Gods**{ .chevron-left }
:       Choose one additional option from the *Rage of the Wilds* feature and gain its benefit.

**Reserve Stamina**{ .chevron-left }
:       You gain 1 use of your expended **:ui-rage: Rage**{ .em }.

**Smite of Origin**{ .chevron-left }
:       After you hit a target with a Strength-based attack, you deal extra **1d6 :dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } damage. The extra damage increases by 1d6 when you reach level 7 (2d6), 11 (3d6), 14 (4d6), and 20 (5d6)

**Primordial Cleaver**{ .chevron-left }
:       Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding, changing its damage type changes to **:dmg-radi: Radiant**{ .dmg-radi } and it gains the :weapon-prop-thrown: Thrown (20/60) property. If you throw the weapon, it instantly reappears in your hand after you hit or miss a target.
