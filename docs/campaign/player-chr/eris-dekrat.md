>*"A man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage.”*

# Sorcerous Origin: Spellbreaker

*"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your power doesn't stem from weaving spells, but from binding and severing them—a Spellbreaker.*

## 1st-level: Bonus Proficiencies

You gain proficiency in Intelligence (Arcana) if you don’t already have it. Moreover, you can add your Charisma modifier to an Intelligence (Arcana) check to recall lore about spells, magic items, or magic symbolism related to your nation.

## 1st-level: Clairvoyance

*You calm yourself down and enter a state of heightened focus, allowing you to sense the weaves of magic that permeate this world.*

Using your :rsc-action: **Action**, you can focus your mind and awaken your senses to see the presence of magic within 60 feet of you for 10 minutes, that is not behind full cover.

When you sense magic in this way, using your :rsc-action: **Action**, you can focus your mind to one object or one creature to learn the following:

- If you focus on an object, you instantly learn the school (or schools) of magic that was used to enchant it, if any.
- If you focus on a creature, you learn its spellcasting ability, if any, and the level of the highest level spell it can cast.

If the object or creature is hidden from divination magic, such as a *nondetection* spell, it appears as if it is mundane or it cannot cast spells.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your rogue level (rounded up), when you have no uses remaining, you can expend a spell slot and regain usage equal to the level of spell slot expended.

## 3rd-level: Spellbreaker’s Mark

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one use of your ^^Clairvoyance^^ and place a Spellbreaker’s Mark on the target, designating it as your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark**. This Mark is only visible to you and you gain the following benefits against your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark**:

- You learn its spellcasting ability, if any, and the level of the highest level spell it can cast.
- The number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark** is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.
- When you damage your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark,** it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to maintain concentration on any spells.
- If your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark** attempts to cast a spell while it is within your reach, you can make an opportunity attack against it.

The :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark** lasts for 1 hour and you can move the **Mark** using a :material-star-four-points: **Reaction**. If your :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark** is reduced to 0 hit point, you can move the :fontawesome-solid-location-crosshairs: **Mark** to a new creature that you can see (no action required).

## 3rd-level: Spellcasting

The weave of magic courses through you, yet you've never bothered to learn how to cast spells or study them. With the cost of teachers being quite high nowadays, you've forged your own path instead of adhering to your nation's tradition. While it may be seen as an insult to the old ways, your methods are just as, if not more, effective.

## 3rd-level: Dekrat's Special:material-trademark:

You've learned how to break the normal rule and convention of casting spells, bend it to your will, and force it through your weapon strike. Does this count as Metamagic?

Once per turn when you make an attack, you can cast a spell, expending spell slot as required, and make a weapon attack with a *finesse* or a ranged weapon that lack the two-handed property which you are proficient. 

To be channeled using a Dekrat's Special:material-trademark: in this way, the spell must met the following requirements:

- The Sorcerer spell must have a casting time of 1 action.
- The Sorcerer spell must require a single spell attack roll or force its target to make a saving throw.

If your attack misses, the spell fails and has no effect. On a hit, the spell takes effect immediately in addition of the normal effects and damage from your weapon attack, under the rules below:

- :material-radius-outline: **Area of Effects.** If the spell targets an area greater than 10 ft. :material-cube-outline: cube, it takes effect as a 15 ft. :material-cone: cone originating from you, which must include your target, or it is contained to only affect the target of your attack (your choice). Using a ranged weapon, your spell is contained to only affect the target of your attack.
- :simple-codemagic: **Cantrip.** The cantrip does not deal damage. Instead, your weapon attack and your Sneak Attack (if applicable) deals the damage type dealt by the cantrip, and applies the cantrip additional effects on hit, except for damage.
- :material-focus-field: **Concentration**. If the spell requires your concentration, you must concentrate on it as soon as it takes effect on hit.
- :material-shield: **Saving Throws**. If the spell requires a saving throw when cast, the target makes the first saving throw at a :d20-disadv:**Disadvantage** on hit. If you score a critical hit on the attack, the target automatically fails its saving throw. Other target (if any) make this save as normal.
- :fontawesome-solid-crosshairs: **Spell Attacks**. If the spell requires a spell attack roll, it instantly take effect when you hit with a weapon attack.
