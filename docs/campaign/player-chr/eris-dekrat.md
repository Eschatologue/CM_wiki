# Dekrat's Anti-Spellcasting Measures:material-trademark:

**Base Sublass:** *[Swashbuckler](../../class/rogue/swashbuckler.md)*

> *A man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage.*

"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your way of weaving spells are quite different from your peers; you combine the power of spells, excessive guile, and the right amount of audacity.

### Level 3: Sorcerous Focus

*Magic flows through all living beings. While others harness it for spells, you've learned to channel it ~~to lock in~~ into razor-sharp focus.*

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You have **:d20-adv: Advantage** on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws against spells and other magical effect.
- You can't have **:d20-adv: Disadvatage** on Dexterity-based weapon attacks.
- You are under the effect of [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic](../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#detect-magic) spell.

You can use this feature **twice** without suffering adverse effects. Each additional use before a **:rest-long: Long Rest** imposes 1 level of ^^Exhaustion^^.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 5: People's Eyebrow

*With a simple raise of your eyebrow, you possess the uncanny ability to disrupt and foil a spellcaster's magic.*

When a creature you can see cast a spell or attempt to Teleport while within 60 feet of you, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to force the target to make a **:d20-save: CON save** against your Cunning Strike DC. On a failed save, it takes **(Sneak Attack) :dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage and its spell or Teleport fails. On a successful save, the target only takes half damage.

You can use this **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } a number of times up to your Charisma modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.
