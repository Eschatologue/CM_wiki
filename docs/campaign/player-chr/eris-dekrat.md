# Dekrat's Anti-Spellcasting Measures:material-trademark:

**Base Sublass:** *[Swashbuckler](../../class/rogue/swashbuckler.md)*

> *A man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage.*

"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your way of weaving spells are quite different from your peers; you combine the power of spells, excessive guile, and the right amount of audacity.

### Level 3: Sorcerous Focus

*Magic flows through all living beings. While others harness it for spells, you've learned to channel it ~~to lock in~~ into razor-sharp focus.*

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{ .rsc }, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on **:d20-save: WIS/INT/CHA Save**{ .d20 } against spells and other magical effect.
- You can't have **:d20-dis: Disadvatage**{ .d20 } on Dexterity-based weapon attacks.
- You are under the effect of [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic](../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#detect-magic) spell. This does not require Concentration, though it's only active for 1 minute.

You can use this feature **twice** without suffering adverse effects. Each additional use before a **:rest-long: Long Rest** imposes 1 level of **Exhaustion**{ .cond }.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 5: People's Eyebrow

*With a simple raise of your eyebrow, you possess the uncanny ability to disrupt and foil a spellcaster's magic.*

When a creature you can see cast a spell or attempt to Teleport while within 60 feet of you, you can take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } to force the target to make a **:d20-save: CON Save**{ .d20 } against your Cunning Strike DC. On a failed save, it takes **(Sneak Attack) :dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage and its spell or Teleport fails. On a successful save, the target only takes half damage.

You can use this **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } a number of times up to your Charisma modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 5: Dekrat's Special:material-trademark:

*You've seamlessly blended your innate magic with your skillful bladework.*

You have learn additional Cunning Strike options, which are described in the "[Dekrat Special Options](#dekrats-special-options)" section later in this gimmick's description.

When you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest** you can change the list of Cunning Stike Options you know, choosing from this list or what's available on the Rogue's Class. The number of Cunning Strike Options you can have at any given time can't exceed cannot exceed your `Proficiency Bonus + 1`.

### Level 7: Sorcerous Restoration

Your innate magic helps you recover your focus more quickly. When you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, you regain **one** expended use of your *Sorcerous Focus*.  

Additionally, while your *Sorcerous Focus* is active, You can apply two *Cunning Strike* option when you deal Sneak Attack damage.
