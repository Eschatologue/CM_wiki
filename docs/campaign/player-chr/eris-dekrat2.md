# Eris Deckrat Gimmick

**Base Sublass:** *[Swashbuckler](../../class/rogue/swashbuckler.md)*

> *A man born into nobility, with a legacy of great achievements, yet devoid of the qualifications, for he carries the weight of his lineage.*

"Sortilege," a Gallian word used for sorcerers, are unlike wizards or others; they're given the power to weave magic as their birthright. You too are this so-called "Sortilege," but your way of weaving spells are quite different from your peers; you combine the power of spells, excessive guile, and the right amount of audacity.

### Level 1: Sorcerous Focus

*Magic flows through all living beings. While others harness it for spells, you've learned to channel it ~~to lock in~~ into razor-sharp focus.*

As a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You have **:d20-adv: Advantage** on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws against spells and other magical effect.
- You can't have **:d20-adv: Disadvatage** on Dexterity-based weapon attacks.
- You are under the effect of [:spell-lv1: Detect Magic](../../spells/description/core/level-1.md#detect-magic) spell.

You can use this feature **twice** without suffering adverse effects. Each additional use before a **:rest-long: Long Rest** imposes 1 level of ^^Exhaustion^^.

You regain all expended uses when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 3: Arcane Knowledge 

*Not knowing much about magic, whatever you believe in is considered facts for you.*

Choose one of the following skills: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion. You gain proficiency with that skill and can use your Charisma instead of Intelligence for ability checks with the chosen skill. You can change the chosen skill when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

### Level 5: Spells and Blades

*You've seamlessly blended your innate magic with your skillful bladework.*

The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options but number of Cunning Strike options you know cannot exceed your Proficiency Bonus + 1. You can change your options when you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

**Transmute**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `1d6`_
:   The *Sneak Attack* damage type's becomes to one of the following damage types of your choice: **:dmg-acid: Acid**{ .dmg-acid }, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{ .dmg-cold }, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire }, **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{ .dmg-lgtn }, or **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun }. If this option is used with another Cunning Strike option, the Sneak Attack damage type of that option becomes the one chosen in this option instead.

**Serrated Edge**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `1d6`_
:   The damage type of the attack becomes **:dmg-force: Force**{ .dmg-force } damage. If this option is used with another Cunning Strike option, the Sneak Attack damage type of that option becomes this option instead.

**Cutting Words**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `2d6`_ 
:   The *Sneak Attack* damage type's becomes **:dmg-psyc: Psychic**{ .dmg-psyc } and the target has **:d20-dis: Disadvantage** on the next D20 Test it makes before the end of its next turn.

:   You takes out the target's ability to speak. It must succeed a **:d20-save: CON Save**{ .d20 } or it has the ^^Silenced^^ condition. At the end of each of its turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Blitz**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `3d6`_

At the end of each of its turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Aftershock**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `4d6`_
:    The *Sneak Attack* damage type's becomes **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } and the target is surounded by booming energy. <br>Until the start of your next turn, the target takes **1d6 :dmg-thun: Thunder**{ .dmg-thun } damage for every 10 feet it moves using its own **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .nowrap }.

**Flare Burst**{ .chevron-left } <br>_Cost: `4d6`_
:    The *Sneak Attack* damage type's becomes **:dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } and each creature within **15-foot :aoe-cone: Cone** originating from the target makes a **:d20-save: DEX Save**{ .d20 }, taking **3d6 :dmg-fire: Fire**{ .dmg-fire } damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. 

### Level 7: Sorcerous Restoration

Your innate magic helps you recover your focus more quickly. When you finish a **:rest-short: Short Rest**, you can regain **one** expended use of your *Sorcerous Focus*.  

Additionally, while your *Sorcerous Focus* is active, the **Cunning Strike** die cost for each option is reduced by `1d6`. If a **Cunning Strike** option requires no dice, you can apply **one additional option** when you deal **Sneak Attack** damage. Only **one** of these options can be a **no-die-cost** effect.
