# Changelog

## 1.0 <small>15 June 2024</small>
The start of this new wiki.

- **[Inventory](../gameplay/homebrew/inventory.md):** Changes to how inventory works. This differs from the system in Prison & Wyvern, so be sure to read through it. It shouldn't affect your current character too much.
- **[Fishing](../gameplay/homebrew/fishing.md):** Changes to the fishing system. This system is completely different from the previous version.
- **[Weapon Properties](../equipment/weapon/index.md#weapon-properties):** Some weapon properties have been altered:
    - **Heavy:** Weapons with the heavy property no longer prevent Small-sized races from using them properly. Instead, they require the user to have a Strength score of 13 (for melee weapons) or a Dexterity score of 13 (for ranged weapons).
    - **Light:** Light weapons and two-weapon fighting are now included in the same description. A weapon with the light property can be used for two-weapon fighting, regardless of whether it is a melee weapon or a ranged weapon.
- **[Race](../character-creation/race/race.md):** Small changes to races, mostly for convenience. These changes shouldn't affect your current character too much.
    - **Ability Score:** All races with innate ability score features, such as Dwarves with +2 STR and +2 CON or Elves with +2 DEX and +1 WIS, have had these features removed. Instead, all races (except for humans) have a +2 and a +1 that they can assign to any ability score.
    - **Starting Feat:** Racial starting feats have been moved to [Background](../character-creation/quickstart.md#3-choose-a-background).
    - **Dragonborn:** Dragonborn can now choose the area of effect of their breath weapon instead of being restricted to either a cone or line. Their damage type and resistances are still restricted by their subrace.
    - **Human, London Lineage:** London Lineage humans now have proficiency in [Resolve Check](../gameplay/homebrew/resolve.md#resolve-check).
    - **Elf, Wood Elf:** Reworded the [Mask of the Wild](../character-creation/race/elf.md#wood-elf) description.
- **[Feat](../character-creation/feat/feat-4th-level.md):**
    - **Fighting Initiate:** This feat has been slightly altered. It is now considered a 4th-level feat, and you choose from the new [list] instead of the Fighter class fighting style list. The Fighter's 1st-level class feature will also pick from this [list] instead of the original one. If your character previously picked this feat, please refer to this [list].
    - **[Crossbow Expert](../character-creation/feat/feat-4th-level.md#crossbow-expert)** (4th-level): Changes to the feat description due to light weapon property changes.
    - **[Gunner](../character-creation/feat/feat-4th-level.md#gunner)** (4th-level): Now allows you to dual-wield firearms with the light property.
