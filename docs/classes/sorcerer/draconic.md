# Draconic Sorcery

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power, perhaps the location where a great dragon was slain. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard, some precious item that was infused with draconic power. Or you might claim a dragon for an ancestor or wield draconic magic by virtue of your Dragonborn heritage.

## Level 3: Draconic Resilience

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier.

## Level 3: Dragon Speech

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. In addition, your speech can be understood by all creatures of the Dragon type.

## Level 6: Elemental Affinity

Your draconic magic has an affinity with one of the damage types associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

## Level 14: Dragon Wings

Your innate magic can now manifest as draconic wings on your back. As a Bonus Action, you sprout those wings, gaining a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. The wings last until you dismiss them as a Bonus Action or you have the Incapacitated condition.

When the wings manifest, you decide whether they’re spectral or physical. If physical, you mustn’t be wearing something that obstructs them.

## Level 18: Draconic Presence

You can channel the dread presence of dragons. As a Bonus Action, you can spend 5 Sorcery Points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) within 60 feet. 

For 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition, each creature of your choice that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have the Charmed (if you chose awe) or Frightened (if you chose fear) condition until the creature is outside the aura.
