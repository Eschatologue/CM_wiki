# Monk: Warrior of the Elements

The tradition of the Four Elements encompasses Monks who tap into the power of the Elemental Planes through their practice of martial arts.

Some of these Monks focus on a single element, learning to wreathe their fists in fire and cause explosive bursts of flame, or to wield mighty gusts of icy wind. Others weave the elements together and learn a variety of techniques to harness the appropriate elemental force for each particular circumstance.

## Level 3: Elemental Attunement

You have attuned yourself with the elemental forces of the multiverse. You know the [Elementalism](../../../spells/cantrip.md#elementalism) cantrip.

In addition, at the start of your turn, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition. You gain the following benefits for the duration:
 
- **Elemental Strikes.** Whenever you hit with your Unarmed Strike, you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning damage rather than its normal damage type.  
When you deal one of these types with your Unarmed Strike, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.

- **Reach.** When you make an Unarmed Strike, your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.

## Level 6: Environmental Burst

As a Magic action, you can spend 2 Discipline Points to cause environmental energy to burst in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of yourself. Choose a damage type: Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning.

Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to three rolls of your Martial Arts die. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

Before or after you take this action, you can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.

## Level 11: Stride Of The Elements

When you use your Step of the Wind, you gain a Fly Speed and Swim Speed equal to your Speed for 10 minutes.

## Level 17: Elemental Epitome

When you use the Elemental Attunement feature, you also gain the following benefits for the duration:

**Damage Resistance.** You gain resistance to one of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning. At the start of each of your turns, you can change this choice.

**Destructive Stride.** When you use your Step of the Wind, your Speed increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn. For that duration, any creature of your choice takes damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die when you enter a space within 5 feet of it. The damage is the same type you chose for this featureâ€™s damage resistance. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
