# Affiliation

In *Crown & Misery*, **Affiliation** represents your character’s ties to one of four societal groups: **Academe, Bohemia, Establishment,** or **Villainy**. These connections influence how the world perceives you, what resources you can access, and who may aid—or oppose—you.  

## Affiliation Points

At character creation, you have **5 Affiliation Points**, which you may distribute among the [four groups](#the-four-circle) as you choose.  

Each point represents your level of influence within that group. A character with **Academe 3**, **Bohemia 2**, **Establishment 0**, **Villainy 0** is well-connected in academic and artistic circles but has no standing among nobles or criminals. A character with **Villainy 5** is deeply entrenched in the criminal underworld but lacks connections elsewhere.

Your Affiliation determines:  

- **Who you can call upon for favours.**  
- **What privileges you have access to.**  
- **How different factions perceive you.**  

The DM will determine **when and how** Affiliation Points are spent or regained.  

### Common Uses of Affiliation 

The following are common usage of Affiliation Points:

**Calling in a Favour**{ .inl } Request aid from a contact, such as an academic granting access to restricted research, an artist spreading a message, or a noble intervening in legal matters.  

**Gaining Access**{ .inl } Enter an exclusive location tied to your Affiliation, such as a royal court, underground club, or hidden temple.  

**Securing Resources**{ .inl } Obtain rare materials, services, or information unique to your Affiliation. This could include spell components, smuggled goods, or an invitation to an elite gathering.  

**Avoiding Trouble**{ .inl } Reduce suspicion, gain leniency, or persuade someone within your Affiliation to overlook a misdeed.  

### Regaining Affiliation Points 

A character’s standing within an Affiliation is not static. Affiliation Points can be restored through in-game actions that strengthen your reputation within a group. The DM determines when Affiliation Points are regained.  

Examples of actions that restore Affiliation include: 

- **Academe:** Publishing research, assisting a scholar, or uncovering lost knowledge.  
- **Bohemia:** Creating renowned art, leading a performance, or influencing culture.  
- **Establishment:** Upholding noble traditions, enforcing laws, or gaining political leverage.  
- **Villainy:** Pulling off a successful crime, eliminating a rival, or protecting an underworld contact.  

## The Four Circle

Each Affiliation represents a distinct societal group with its own **values, power structures, and expectations**.
