# Background

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

## Parts of a Background & Custom Background

Your character's background is the collection of characteristics that they picked up during the formative years of their life. These are the experiences and occupations your character engaged in separate from their upbringing and species, and prior to their life as an adventurer.

Each background includes the following elements, which you can either choose from existing options or customize to fit your character's story.

Mechanically, your background contains six plus one aspects detailed as follow, a **Custom Background** follows the same formula:

**:material-arrow-up-bold-box: Ability Scores**
:   Increase your Ability Score, these increases cannot raise any score above **20**, choose **(A)** or **(B)**

    - **(A)** Increase **_one_ Ability Score by `+2`** and **_another_ by `+1`**
    - **(B)** Increase **_three_ Ability Scores by `+1` each**.

### Backstory

Not to be confused with Backgrounds, a Backstory is the actual story that your character experienced before the present. Who are they? Where were they born? What inspires them to take up the adventuring way of life? What is the background reason for your character being in a certain class? The backstory can be as simple or as elaborate as you like, but please keep it grounded under the [Three Core Principles](../../create-your-character.md#the-core-principles).

This [article](https://5e.tools/book.html#XGE,1,this%20is%20your%20life,0) provides a good example of how to construct your backstory.

## Common Background
