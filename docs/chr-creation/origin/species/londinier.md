The Londiniers arrived in Antares through the Northern Gate, bringing industrial might, tactical brilliance, and a fanatical devotion to their homeland. Alien to the Weave and hardened by centuries of warfare, they are a people of innovation, steel, and blood.

### Class Restriction

You are restricted from choosing the **Bard**, **Cleric**, **Druid**, **Sorcerer**, and **Wizard** classes.

??? info "Why Restriction?"

    Humans from the Albion are outsiders in Antares. As a result, the Weave of magic does not interact with them in the same way it does with the native races, rendering them unable to perform direct spellcraft. However, a small number of Londiniers have found ways to wield magic, often through the use of technological innovations, casting units, or ancient artifacts that contain magical properties.
