# Starting at Higher Levels

Your DM might start your group's characters at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&D players.

## Starting Equipment

The DM decides whether your character starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 character, possibly even one or more magic items. The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a guide for the DM.

Also, check with your DM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money.

##### Starting Equipment at Higher Levels
| Starting Level | Equipment and Money | Magic Items |
|:-:|---|---|
| 2-4 | Normal starting equipment | 1 Common |
| 5-10 | 5,000 SP plus 1d10 × 250 SP plus normal starting equipment | 1 Common, 1 Uncommon |
| 11-16 | 50,000 SP plus 1d10 × 2,500 SP plus normal starting equipment | 2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare |
| 17-20 | 200,000 SP plus 1d10 × 2,500 SP plus normal starting equipment | 2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare |
