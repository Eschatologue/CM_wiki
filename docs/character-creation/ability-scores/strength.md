Strength is an Ability Score and the primary ability of Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin.

Strength affects your Athletics skill and :d20-attack: **Attack Rolls** so you become better at melee combat. It also determines how far you can jump, how much you can carry and how far you can shove (possibly based on Athletics).

## Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

### Athletics

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt mid jump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

## Uses of Strength

### :d20-attack: **Attack Rolls** and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

### Carrying Capacity

A creature's Strength score is used to determine how much weight a creature can carry before becoming encumbered.
