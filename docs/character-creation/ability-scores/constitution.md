Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

## Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster.

## Uses of Constitution

### Hit Points

Creatures add their Constitution modifier to the amount of hit points they gain on level up. This increase is applied retroactively.
