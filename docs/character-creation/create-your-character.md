# Creating Your Character

This D&D campaign setting uses the same rulings as what you would find in other settings with minor additions and modifications. On a notable note, it uses combinations of 5th Edition ruling and 2024 PHB ruling.

## The Core Principles

When creating your character, you must adhere to three core principles that apply at all times, both during roleplaying and gameplay.

#### Team Cooperation

**Your character must consistently work with and support the rest of the party.**

:   A rogue who steals from party members or sabotages plans undermines group cohesion. Instead, create a rogue who uses their skills to benefit the party, like scouting ahead, gathering intelligence, or disarming traps to ensure safe passage for the group. Another example is a bard who not only performs to inspire allies but also uses their charm and wit to negotiate and forge alliances that benefit the entire party.

#### Plot Engagement

**Your character must be consistently willing to engage with the campaign's plot.**

:   A character who refuses to participate in the main quest or constantly separates from the group disrupts the story. Instead, design a character with personal motivations that align with the campaign's goals, such as a ranger seeking revenge on the antagonist responsible for the apocalypse or a cleric on a mission to restore order and help survivors. These motivations should naturally lead the character to be involved in key events and conflicts of the campaign.

#### Setting and Tone

**Your character must plausibly fit into the campaign's setting and align with the overall tone of the campaign.**
 
:   This setting uses a post-apocalyptic dystopian science fantasy world, characters should blend modern and fantasy elements. A traditional medieval knight would be out of place. Instead, create a knight equipped armour combining modern technology enchanted with ancient runes. Similarly, a mage might use arcane spells alongside gadgets, and a ranger could be adept at surviving in both urban ruins and wild wastelands, utilizing a mix of traditional skills and contemporary tools.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Here are the steps to make a character; each step is explored in detail in this chapter:

### Step 1: Choosing a Class

Please choose a class from the available options listed.

You can also choose to Multiclass when the prerequisites are met.

#### Write Your Level

Write your character's level on your character sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and advances in level by adventuring and gaining Experience Points (XP) or by **milestones**.

***Write Your XP.*** Also record your Experience Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.

***Starting at a Higher Level.*** Your DM might start you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in the chapter for more information.

#### Note Armour Training

Your class might give you training with certain categories of armour. Note your armour training on your character sheet. Armour training with a kind of armour means you can wear that armour effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it.

#### Hold That Thought

You'll fill in more details about your class later. Choosing your class is the most important decision you make in creating a character, and it informs many of the decisions you make in later steps. You'll return to your class's description in chapter 3 several more times before you're done.

### Step 2: Determine Origin

#### Choose a Background

Choose your character's background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed in chapter 4, or your DM might offer additional backgrounds as options. For Crown & Misery, this campaign uses the **Custom Background** ruling, available in Background section.

#### Choose Starting Equipment

Your background and class both provide starting equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step can be immediately spent on equipment. In addition, you can have one [trinket](trinket.md) at no cost.

#### Choose a Species

Choose a Species for your character. Once you've chosen a species, write it on your character sheet. Then record your species' traits.

Your character's size and Speed are determined by the character's species; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well (you may write just the first letter of your size).

#### Imagine Your Past and Present

Let your character's background and species inspire how you imagine their past. That past fed into the character's present. With that in mind, consider answers to the following questions as your character:

- Who raised you?
- Who was your dearest childhood friend?
- Did you grow up with a pet?
- Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
- Did you join an organization, such as a guild or religion? If so, are you still a member of it?
- What elements of your past inspire you to go on adventures now?
 
This [article](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/this-is-your-life) provides a good example of how to construct your backstory.

#### Choose Languages

Your character knows at least three languages: **Common plus two languages** you roll or choose from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a language means your character can communicate in it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features might also give you languages.

The Standard Languages table lists languages that are widespread on D&D worlds. Every player character knows Common, which originated in the planar metropolis of Sigil, the hub of the multiverse. The other standard languages originated with the first members of the most prominent species in the worlds of D&D and have since spread widely.

=== "PHB'24"

    ##### Standard Languages

    | 1d12 | Language | Origin |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | — | Common | Sigil |
    | 1 | Common Sign Language | Sigil |
    | 2 | Draconic | Dragons |
    | 3–4 | Dwarvish | Dwarves |
    | 5–6 | Elvish | Elves |
    | 7 | Giant | Giants |
    | 8 | Gnomish | Gnomes |
    | 9 | Goblin | Goblinoids |
    | 10–11 | Halfling | Halflings |
    | 12 | Orc | Orcs |

=== "CM"

    Languages in Crown & Misery are based on the country of Origin rather than a creature’s species. However a creature of a specific species may culturally know the language given by the RAW. Typically a person knows Common, the language of their nation, and the language of their culture or people.

    During character creation you may replace any languages your character knows with another if it suits their background.

    Compiled is a list of languages, the races that commonly speak it and which nation uses it primarily. 

    ##### Crown & Misery Standard Languages

    | 1d12 | Language | Typical Speakers | National Language | Real Life Counterpart |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | - | Common | Everyone | All | French |
    | 1 | Draconic | Dragonborn | Karakorum | Chinese, Japanes, Old Mongolian |
    | 2-3 | Dwarvish | Dwarves | Myrkheim | Icelandic |
    | 4-5 | Elvish | Elves | Albion, Valinor | Uralic (Finnish/Hungarian) |
    | 6 | Giant | Ogres, Giants | Myrkheim, Soterrano | Old Norse |
    | 7-8 | Gnomish | Gnomes | Albion, Soterrano | Norwegian |
    | 9 | Goblin | Goblinoids | Gallia, Soterrano | Italian, Spanish |
    | 10 | Halfling | Halflings | Albion, Karakorum | Alsatian |
    | 11 | Orc | Orcs (Continental) | Gallia, Myrkheim | German |
    | 12 | English^CM^ | Londoners | Albion | English |

The Rare Languages table lists languages that are either secret or derived from other planes of existence and thus less widespread in the worlds of the Material Plane. Some features let a character learn a rare language.

##### Rare Languages Table

| Language | Origin |
|---|---|
| Abyssal | Demons of the Abyss |
| Celestial | Celestials |
| Deep Speech | Aberrations |
| Druidic | Druidic circles |
| Infernal | Devils of the Nine Hells |
| Primordial* | Elementals |
| Sylvan | The Feywild |
| Thieves' Cant | Various criminal guilds |
| Undercommon | The Underdark |

*Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects. Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with those that know a different one.

### Step 3: Starting Ability Scores

In this setting, we uses the Standard Array as follow: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8

Simply assign one number to each Ability Score (one to Strength, one to Dexterity, one to Constitution, and so on). Then, you'll be able to determine your character's modifier for each score.

#### Ability Scores

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An Ability Score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Because ability modifiers affect almost every :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**, :d20-check: **Ability Check**, and :d20-save: **Saving Throw**, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers Table

| score | modifier | score | modifier |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

??? tip "Optimization"

    This DnD setting emphasizes character optimization, so it's crucial to seek advice or research how to best allocate your starting stats for your character concept and for its class. Properly optimized stats can greatly enhance your gameplay experience and ensure your character excels in their chosen role.

    While following the meta isn't mandatory, it's important not to mishandle your Ability Scores.

#### Describe Appearance and Personality

Ability scores are an essential part of the rules, but they can be more than that. Once you've assigned your ability scores, give some thought to what those scores might say about your character's appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Charisma might look and behave differently from a charismatic character with low Strength. The following tables of descriptive words give suggestions of how you might describe your character based on having a high or low score in an ability.

=== "Strength"

    | 1d4 | High Strength | Low Strength |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Muscular | Weak |
    | 2 | Sinewy | Slight |
    | 3 | Protective | Self-conscious |
    | 4 | Direct | Indirect |

=== "Dexterity"

    | 1d4 | High Dexterity | Low Dexterity |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Lithe | Jittery |
    | 2 | Dynamic | Clumsy |
    | 3 | Fidgety | Hesitant |
    | 4 | Poised | Unsteady |

=== "Constitution"

    | 1d4 | High Constitution | Low Constitution |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Energetic | Frail |
    | 2 | Hale | Squeamish |
    | 3 | Hearty | Lethargic |
    | 4 | Stable | Fragile |

=== "Intelligence"

    | 1d4 | High Intelligence | Low Intelligence |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Decisive | Artless |
    | 2 | Logical | Illogical |
    | 3 | Informative | Uninformed |
    | 4 | Curious | Frivolous |

=== "Wisdom"

    | 1d4 | High Wisdom | Low Wisdom |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Serene | Rash |
    | 2 | Considerate | Distracted |
    | 3 | Attentive | Oblivious |
    | 4 | Wary | Naive |

=== "Charisma"

    | 1d4 | High Charisma | Low Charisma |
    |:-:|---|---|
    | 1 | Charming | Pedantic |
    | 2 | Commanding | Humorless |
    | 3 | Hilarious | Reserved |
    | 4 | Inspiring | Tactless |

### Step 4: Choose an Alignment

Choose your character's alignment from the options below, and note it on your character sheet.

D&D assumes that player characters aren't of an evil alignment. Check with your DM before making an evil character. 

#### The Nine Alignments

A creature's alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).

The summaries of the alignments below describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment; individuals can vary from that behavior.

***Lawful Good (LG)*** 

:   Lawful Good creatures endeavor to do the right thing as expected by society. Someone who fights injustice and protects the innocent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.

***Neutral Good (NG)*** 

:   Neutral Good creatures do the best they can, working within rules but not feeling bound by them. A kindly person who helps others according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.

***Chaotic Good (CG)*** 

:   Chaotic Good creatures act as their conscience directs with little regard for what others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron's tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the poor is probably Chaotic Good.

***Lawful Neutral (LN)*** 

:   Lawful Neutral individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of life—and isn't swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil—is probably Lawful Neutral.

***Neutral (N)*** 

:   Neutral is the alignment of those who prefer to avoid moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Someone who's bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.

***Chaotic Neutral (CN)*** 

:   Chaotic Neutral creatures follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.

***Lawful Evil (LE)*** 

:   Lawful Evil creatures methodically take what they want within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploiting citizens while scheming for power is probably Lawful Evil.

***Neutral Evil (NE)*** 

:   Neutral Evil is the alignment of those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.

***Chaotic Evil (CE)*** 

:   Chaotic Evil creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.

### Step 5: Fill In Details

Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.

#### Record Class Features

Look at your class's feature table in chapter 3, and write down the level 1 features. The class features are detailed in that same chapter.

Some class features offer choices. Make sure to read all your features and make any offered choices.

#### Fill In Numbers

Note these numbers on your character sheet.

***Saving Throws*** 

:   For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

***Skills*** 

:   For skills you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you're not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

***Passive Perception*** 

:   Sometimes your DM will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; the DM uses your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you're not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:

<p style="text-align:center;">

<strong>Passive Perception</strong> = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier

</p>

:   Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

***Hit Points*** 

:   Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.

##### Level 1 Hit Points by Class

| **Class** | **Hit Die** | **Hit Points at 1st Level** |
|---|---|---|
| Barbarian | d12 | 12 + Constitution modifier |
| Fighter | d10 | 10 + Constitution modifier |
| Paladin | d10 | 10 + Constitution modifier |
| Ranger | d10 | 10 + Constitution modifier |
| Artificer | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Bard | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Cleric | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Druid | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Monk | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Rogue | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Warlock | d8 | 8 + Constitution modifier |
| Sorcerer | d6 | 6 + Constitution modifier |
| Wizard | d6 | 6 + Constitution modifier |

***Hit Point Dice*** 

:   Your class's description tells you the die type of your character's Hit Point Dice (or Hit Dice for short); write this on your character sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space to note how many Hit Dice you've spent.

***Initiative*** 

:   Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.

***Armour Class*** 

:   Without armour or a shield, your base Armour Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armour or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in chapter 6. A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

***Attacks*** 

:   In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips section of the character sheet, write your starting weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with which you have proficiency is one of the following unless a weapon's property says otherwise:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Melee attack bonus</strong> = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Ranged attack bonus</strong> = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus
</p>

:   Look up the damage and properties of your weapons in chapter 6. You add the same ability modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your damage rolls with that weapon.

***Spellcasting*** 

:   Note both the saving throw DC for your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you make with them, using these formulas:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<strong>Spell attack bonus</strong> = spellcasting ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
</p>

:   Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is determined by whatever feature gives you the ability to cast the spell.

***Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells*** 

:   If your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, your class features table shows the number of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips you know, and how many spells you can prepare. Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note them—along with your number of spell slots—on your character sheet.

#### Name Your Character

Choose a name for your character, and write it on your character sheet. The name can be whatever you like. Was it the name of an ancestor? Does it have religious or other significance? Is it a name you chose for yourself?
