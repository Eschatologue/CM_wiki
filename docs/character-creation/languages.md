## Languages in Crown & Misery

Your race determines the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might grant you access to additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Just because two languages use the same script doesn't mean you can comprehend both. For example, you might understand English, but if shown a writing in French, you can read it but not comprehend it.

### Standard Languages
Standard languages are the most common languages spoken in Antares. When a Background, Class, or Racial feature allows the knowledge of a language, you can only select from the standard languages listed below.

##### Standard Languages Table
| **Language** | **Typical Speakers** | **Script** | **Real Life Counterpart** |
| :-- | --- | --- | --- |

### Exotic Languages
Exotic languages are rare and typically not accessible to your character unless a class, race, or background feature grants you the ability to speak them. With the DM's discretion, you may learn these languages.

## Relating Celestial Language

*Main Article: [Celestial]*

Celestial is known by many names, including god-tongue, correspondence, and Aesirian, but it is often academically referred to as "celestial." It is the oldest of the alphabets, maddening, and often inflammatory.

Since the opening of the [Northern Gate](../lore/entry/the-gate.md), understanding the celestial tongue has shifted from a reckless indulgence to an urgent necessity. The risks, however – madness and combustion – are substantial.

Celestial is a very dangerous language to learn, with more lethal repercussions than academic benefits. However, for some, the benefits outweigh the risks. 

Your character cannot naturally learn celestial, even it is stated as a racial trait, class features, or background!
