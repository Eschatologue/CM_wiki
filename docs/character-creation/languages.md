## Languages in Crown & Misery

Your race determines the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might grant you access to additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Just because two languages use the same script doesn't mean you can comprehend both. For example, you might understand English, but if shown a writing in French, you can read it but not comprehend it.

### Standard Languages
Standard languages are the most common languages spoken in Antares. When a Background, Class, or Racial feature allows the knowledge of a language, you can only select from the standard languages listed below.

##### Standard Languages Table
| **Language** | **Typical Speakers** | **Script** | **Real Life Counterpart** |
| .-- | --- | --- | --- |

| Orc | Orcs | Dwarvish | Norse / Icelandic |

### Exotic Languages
Exotic languages are rare and typically not accessible to your character unless a class, race, or background feature grants you the ability to speak them. With the DM's discretion, you may learn these languages.

## Relating Celestial Language

Celestial is known by many names, including god-tongue, correspondence, and Aesirian, but it is often academically referred to as "celestial." It is the oldest of the alphabets, maddening, and often inflammatory.

Since the opening of the northern gate, understanding the celestial tongue has shifted from a reckless indulgence to an urgent necessity. The risks, however – madness and combustion – are substantial.

Celestial is a very dangerous language to learn, with more lethal repercussions than academic benefits. However, for some, the benefits outweigh the risks. Your character cannot naturally learn celestial, as it is banned in almost all nations, and only a select, insane, and suicidal few are authorized to know and possibly speak it.

### Speaking Celestial

Speaking celestial is fraught with peril. Those who attempt to learn or speak this ancient and powerful language often face horrifying consequences. Known effects include:

- **Madness.** Prolonged exposure to celestial can drive individuals insane, fracturing their minds beyond repair.
- **Spontaneous Combustion.** The act of speaking celestial can cause spontaneous combustion, reducing the speaker to ashes in moments.
- **Seared Tongue.** The tongue of anyone who attempts to speak celestial can be seared with the script, sometimes rendering them unable to speak or eat properly.
- **Inescapable Nightmares.** Speakers of celestial are often haunted by inescapable nightmares that blur the line between reality and the dream world.
- **Physical Deformities.** Prolonged exposure can lead to grotesque physical deformities as the body contorts under the language's influence.
- **Exploding Head.** In extreme cases, attempting to speak or understand celestial can cause one's head to explode, leaving nothing but a gruesome mess.
- **Burning Eyes.** The very act of reading celestial script can cause the eyes to burn out, leaving the reader blind and in excruciating pain.
- **Banished.** Speaking celestial can result in the speaker being banished to random parts of the continent, disoriented and lost.
- **Simultaneous Effects.** Some unlucky individuals might experience all these horrors at once.

Even thinking about the letters of celestial can cause a rapid increase in body temperature, making one feel as though they are burning from within. The mere contemplation of this language is a perilous endeavor, reserved only for those who are either incredibly desperate, utterly reckless or both.

### Writing Celestial

Writing celestial is equally perilous and destructive. The mere act of inscribing these ancient symbols can set the very medium ablaze. Anything written in celestial ignites or combusts when exposed to direct air and sunlight, making research extremely challenging. Known effects include:

- **Instant Combustion.** Paper and other flammable materials will burst into flames almost immediately upon being written in celestial.
- **Environmental Hazard.** The act of writing celestial in an open environment can cause uncontrolled fires, putting entire buildings and lives at risk.
- **Bodily Harm.** The act of writing celestial can cause physical harm to the scribe, including burns, spontaneous bleeding, and rapid deterioration of health.
- **Mental Strain.** The process of writing celestial is mentally exhausting and can lead to severe cognitive decline or insanity.

The safest known method to document celestial is inscribing it on thick stone tablets or, as the Londoners have innovated, on sheets of metal made out of steel. Even then, the script must be transferred to a new piece every few hours due to the melting steel.
