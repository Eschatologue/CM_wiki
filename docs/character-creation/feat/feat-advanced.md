### Artifice Conflux

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+)*  

Through your repeated exposure to the natural flow of arcane magic throughout your world and beyond, you've adapted to attune with additional Enchantments, though the process can be physically taxing. You gain the following benefits:

**Experienced**  
You have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when investigating the nature of a magical object or device.
    
**Increased Attunement**  
You can now be attuned to a maximum of four magical items, rather than the normal limit of three. Other attunement limitations still apply.
    
**Examine**  
You can ritual cast the *identify* spell, ignoring all the spells' component. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Dual-Focused

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Mage or Priest Group)*

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

**Manifest power**  
If you attempt to cast a spell that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must take a Magic action on each subsequent round on maintaining this Concentration, or lose it for both spells.
    
**Burden**  
At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution :d20-save: **Saving Throw** (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you've been concentrating on two spells). On a failure, you lose concentration for both spells. You can drop concentration on one of your spells during your turn as a free action to avoid this :d20-save: **Saving Throw**.

Any time you would be forced to make a Concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On fail, you lose concentration on both spells
