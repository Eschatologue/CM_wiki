Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to mystically lend to your companions whenever you see them falter. You're not sure how you do it, you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!

- **Reroll**

    When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for a D20 Tests, you can use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll. When you use this ability, you can't use your Lucky racial trait before the end of your next turn

- **Mighty Roar**
    
    Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it canâ€™t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
