# 8th-level Feats

The feats listed below are available on 8th-level and above.

## Feat Descriptions

### Adrenaline Rush
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Warrior Group

**Repeatable:** No

You learn how to push yourself beyond your normal limits.

- **What a Rush!**
    
     **On your turn, you can expend one of your Hit Die and gain one additional action. You can use this feature once and gain expended use on a long rest.

### Artifice Conflux
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Expert Group or [Artificer Initiate](feat-starting.md#artificer-initiate) Feat

**Repeatable:** No

Through your repeated exposure to the natural flow of arcane magic throughout your world and beyond, you’ve adapted to attune with additional enchantments, though the process can be physically taxing. You gain the following benefits:

- **Experienced**
    
    You have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when investigating the nature of a magical object or device.
    
- **Robust**
    
    You can now be attuned to a maximum of four magical items, rather than the normal limit of three. Other attunement limitations still apply.
    
- **Examine**
    
    You can ritual cast the *identify* spell, ignoring all the spells' component. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Dual-Focused
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Mage or Priest Group

**Repeatable:** No

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

- **Manifest power**
    
    If you attempt to cast a spell that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must spend a standard action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both spells.
    
- **Burden**
    
    At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you’ve been concentrating on two spells). On a failure, you lose concentration for both spells. You can drop concentration on one of your spells during your turn as a free action to avoid this saving throw.
    
    Any time you would be forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells’ levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells

### Great Weapon Expert
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Warrior Group or [Great Weapon Master](feat-4th-level.md#great-weapon-master) feat

**Repeatable:** No

You have mastered the usage of heavy weapons, using their weight and size for maximum lethality.

- **Improved Critical**
    
    The number you need to roll for a Critical Hit while attacking with *heavy* or *versatile* weapon is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.
    
- **Heavyweight Throwing**
    
    When you throw a weapon with a *heavy* property, its damage die becomes the weapon damage die instead of d4.

### Magically Imbibed
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Mage or Priest Group

**Repeatable:** No

Your faith grants you great insight into magic, giving you a special privilege with it as if magic itself favors you.

- **Encrpyted Spells**
    
    When someone attempts to dispel or counterspell your magic, if they are required to make a roll for it to succeed, your DC is increased by your spellcasting modifier.
    
- **Magic Resistance**
    
    When you make a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect, you can gain advantage on the roll. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
    
- **Arcane Absorbtion**
    
    When you expend a spell slot, roll a d20. On a 20, you regain a spell slot of a level lower than expended spell slot, up to a maximum level equal to your proficiency bonus, and a minimum level of 1
    
    You can regain a total number of spell slot levels equal to your proficiency bonus this way until you cannot regain further spell slots until you complete a long rest.

### Shield Prodigy
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Warrior Group or [Shield Master](feat-4th-level.md#shield-masterhb) feat

**Repeatable:** No

After fine tuning your equipment, you can do things others can’t with shields.

- **Sunder**
    
    As part of the attack action, you instead throw your shield as a ranged attack that you are proficient in using your Dexterity or Strength modifiers (you decide when you select this feat) and aim for one target within 30 feet with your shield. On hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and goes prone.
    
    Hit or miss, at the end of the attack your shield harmlessly bounces back to you.
    
- **Deflection**
    
    You can use your Reaction to deflect the incoming damage when you are hit by an Attack or fail a saving throw from a projectile. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by your Proficiency Bonus + half your level.
    
- **Interpose**
    
    You can use a bonus action to protect a creature within 5 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against that creature has disadvantage if you can see the attacker. This benefit ends early if you are incapacitated or your speed drops to 0.

### Spell Driver
*8th-level Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Priest or Mage Group, or Spellcasting/Pact Magic feature

**Repeatable:** No

Through intense focus, training, and dedication, you’ve harnessed the techniques of rapid spellcasting.

- **Arcane Succession**
    
    You are no longer limited to only one non-cantrip spell per turn. However, should you cast two or more spells in a single turn, only one of them can be of 3rd level or higher.
    
### Theurgy

**Prerequisites:** Intelligence (Religion) expertise or Priest Group

**Repeatable:** Yes, pick a different channel divinity option each time

You learn how to channel divine power given by the divine.

- **Two Cantrips**

- **Channel Divinity**
    
    Choose a cleric domain, you gain a channel divinity feature granted by that domain. You can use this feature twice and regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. If a channel divinity option uses Wisdom of its effect, you can use either your Intelligence or Charisma for it.
