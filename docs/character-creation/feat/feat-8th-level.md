### Artifice Conflux

*Level 8 Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Expert Group or [Artificer Initiate](feat-starting.md#artificer-initiate) Feat  
**Repeatable:** No

Through your repeated exposure to the natural flow of arcane magic throughout your world and beyond, you’ve adapted to attune with additional Enchantments, though the process can be physically taxing. You gain the following benefits:

- **Experienced**
    
    You have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on Intelligence (Arcana) checks when investigating the nature of a magical object or device.
    
- **Robust**
    
    You can now be attuned to a maximum of four magical items, rather than the normal limit of three. Other attunement limitations still apply.
    
- **Examine**
    
    You can ritual cast the *identify* spell, ignoring all the spells' component. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for this spell.

### Dual-Focused

*Level 8 Feat*

**Prerequisites:** Mage or Priest Group  
**Repeatable:** No

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

- **Manifest power**
    
    If you attempt to cast a spell that requires concentration while already concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must spend a standard action each subsequent round on maintaining this concentration, or lose concentration for both spells.
    
- **Burden**
    
    At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are concentrating on, you must make a Constitution :d20-save: **Saving Throw** (DC equals 10 + the number of complete rounds you’ve been concentrating on two spells). On a failure, you lose concentration for both spells. You can drop concentration on one of your spells during your turn as a free action to avoid this :d20-save: **Saving Throw**.
    
    Any time you would be forced to make a C due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells’ levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells

- **Heavyweight Throwing**
    
    When you throw a weapon with a :weapon-prop-heavy: **Heavy** property, its damage die becomes the weapon damage die.

- **Ringing Blows**
    
    When you miss a melee attack with a :weapon-prop-heavy: **Heavy** weapon, you can deal damage to that creature equal to your Ability Modifier used to make the :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**.

- **Excessive Force**
    
    When you hit a ranged attack with a :weapon-prop-heavy: **Heavy** weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller sized. If you score a Critical Hit, the creature is becomes prone.

    When someone attempts to dispel or *counterspell* your magic, if they are required to make a check for it to succeed, your DC is increased by your spellcasting modifier.
    
- **Magic Resistance**

**Prerequisites:** Warrior Group or [Shield Master](feat-4th-level.md#shield-masterhb) feat  
**Repeatable:** No

After fine tuning your equipment, you can do things others can’t with shields.

- **Sunder**
    
    As part of the attack action, you instead throw your shield as a ranged attack that you are proficient in using your Dexterity or Strength modifiers (you decide when you select this feat) and aim for one target within 30 feet with your shield. On hit, the target takes 1d8 :dmg-bludgeoning: Bludgeoning damage and has the Prone condition.
    
    Hit or miss, at the end of the attack your shield harmlessly bounces back to you.

- **Interpose**
    
    You can use a :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** to protect a creature within 5 feet of you. Until the start of your next turn, any :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** made against that creature has :d20-disadv: **disadvantage** if you can see the attacker.
