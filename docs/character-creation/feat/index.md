# Feats

A feat represents a Talent or an area of Expertise that gives a character Special capabilities. It embodies Training, experience, and Abilities beyond what a class provides.

## Parts of a Feat
The description of a Feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the Feat's name:

**Level.** Each Feat has a level. To take a Feat, your level must equal or exceed the Feat's level.

**Prerequisite.** You must meet any prerequisite specified in a Feat to take that Feat, unless a special feature allows you to take the Feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite is a Class or a Class Group, you must have at least 1 level in an eligible Class to qualify for the Feat.

**Repeatable.** If a Feat is repeatable, you can take it more than once. If it isn't repeatable, you can take the Feat only once. Every feat has its own condition to be repeated.

## How to Read Feat Prerequisites

Feats in D&D can provide your character with new capabilities or improve existing ones. However, not all feats are available to every character at all times. Some feats have prerequisites that must be met before your character can select them. Hereâ€™s how to understand and read these prerequisites:

### Class Requirements
Some feats can only be taken by characters of certain classes. For example, a feat might require you to be a Cleric.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Cleric class

### Ability Score Requirements
Many feats require a minimum score in one or more ability scores. This ensures that only characters with a particular aptitude can benefit from the feat.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Strength 13+
- Prerequisite: Dexterity 13+, Wisdom 13+

### Skill Proficiency Requirements
Some feats require Proficiency in specific skills. This shows that only characters who have trained in these skills can access the feat.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in Religion
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in both Religion and Arcana

### Multiple Requirements
Some feats have multiple prerequisites. These must all be met for a character to take the feat.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in Religion; Wisdom 13+
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in both Religion and Arcana; Wisdom 13+

### Either/Or Requirements
Some feats offer alternative prerequisites, where meeting any one of the listed conditions allows you to take the feat.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in both Religion and Arcana, or Cleric class
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in Athletics or Strength 13+

### Combination Requirements
In some cases, a feat might have a combination of prerequisites, where you must meet a certain number of listed conditions.

**Example:**  
- Prerequisite: Proficiency in both Religion and Arcana, or Cleric class; Wisdom 13+
