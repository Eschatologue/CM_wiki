- **Lash and Trip**
    
    Once per turn when you deal damage with a whip or weighted chain to a creature that is no more than one size larger than you, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier). On a failure, you choose whether the creature drops one object of your choice that it’s holding, falls prone, or has its movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.
    
- **Quicklash**
    
    When you take the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a whip or weighted chain you are holding.
