There are 9 playable races in Crown & Misery, each with unique subraces that further define a character's strengths and abilities. For more details, refer to the descriptions of each race on this page, as some races have been mechanically altered.

Note that Crown & Misery uses slightly modified rules from the standard PHB and TCE. Most races receive a +2 and a +1 bonus to different ability scores (no single ability score can receive a +3). Humans are an exception, as they receive two feats at 1st level instead of the usual one.
