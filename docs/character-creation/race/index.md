## Race Changes in Crown & Misery

Crown & Misery introduces changes to the original races from the PHB and TCE to better fit the world settings. This is not an exhaustive list.

### Lore
Some races' lore has been slightly altered in Crown & Misery. For example, while elves traditionally live in forests, in this world, they "used to." Feel free to ask the DM for more details regarding the lore behind the races for reference when creating your backgrounds.

### Ability Scores
Crown & Misery follows a method similar to Baldur's Gate 3 for handling Ability Scores. Instead of each race having predetermined Ability Scores, all races (except humans) receive a +2 to any Ability Score and a +1 to any other score for flexibility. Races with innate spellcasting still have restrictions on their spellcasting ability, usually Charisma.

### Innate Expertise
Some races allow you to apply double your Proficiency Bonus on checks in highly specific situations. These have been slightly altered, either by simplifying the situations or by granting the associated Proficiencies directly.

### Dragonborn's Breath Weapon
In the PHB, Dragonborn have a myriad of ancestry options. In Crown & Misery, this has been restricted to a few, but now Dragonborn can choose the area of effect for their breath weapon (cone or line) at will, instead of having these options restricted to specific ancestries.

### Sunlight Sensitivity
Sunlight Sensitivity has been removed. The night is lethal in Antares, and it would be an inconvenience in most situations. However, feel free to roleplay your Drow character wearing sunglasses and using sunscreen at all times.
