# Race

There are 9 playable races in Crown & Misery, each with unique subraces that further define a character's strengths and abilities. For more details, refer to the descriptions of each race on this page, as some races have been mechanically altered.

## Race Changes in Crown & Misery

Crown & Misery introduces changes to the original races from the PHB and TCE to better fit the world settings. This is not an exhaustive list.

### Lore
Some races' lore has been slightly altered in Crown & Misery. For example, while elves traditionally live in forests, in this world, they "used to." Feel free to ask the DM for more details regarding the lore behind the races for reference when creating your backgrounds.

### Ability Scores
Crown & Misery follows a method similar to Baldur's Gate 3 for handling Ability Scores. Instead of each race having predetermined Ability Scores, all races (except humans) receive a +2 to any Ability Score and a +1 to any other score for flexibility. Races with innate spellcasting still have restrictions on their spellcasting ability, usually Charisma.

### Innate Expertise
Some races allow you to apply double your Proficiency Bonus on checks in highly specific situations. These have been slightly altered, either by simplifying the situations or by granting the associated Proficiencies directly.

### Dragonborn's Breath Weapon
In the PHB, Dragonborn have a myriad of ancestry options. In Crown & Misery, this has been restricted to a few, but now Dragonborn can choose the area of effect for their breath weapon (cone or line) at will, instead of having these options restricted to specific ancestries.

### Sunlight Sensitivity
Sunlight Sensitivity has been removed. The night is lethal in Antares, and it would be an inconvenience in most situations. However, feel free to roleplay your Drow character wearing sunglasses and using sunscreen at all times.

## Choosing a Race

Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.

Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Other races and subraces are less common as adventurers.

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career.

When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.

Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies.

These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.

## Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

###Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

###Size

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.

Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 5.

### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling and fighting.

### Languages

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

### Subraces

Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.
