"A proud race, prioritizing clan loyalty and individual prowess above all else. Their ancestors endured servitude under the Aeginaes, acting as their executors, leading to their fear and ostracization by other races. Determined to maintain self-sufficiency, they refuse to be indebted to anyone, including once the Gods, and now, the Spires."
