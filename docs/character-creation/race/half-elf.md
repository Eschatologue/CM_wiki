"Half-Elves walk a delicate line, inheriting the blessings of both their human and elven lineage while grappling with a sense of not truly belonging. They blend the inquisitiveness, ingenuity, and drive of humans with the heightened senses, appreciation for nature, and artistic inclinations of elves."
