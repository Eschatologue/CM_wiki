*Once a revered race, the elves commanded respect across Antares. Yet, they fell from grace, losing their ancient forest, their ties to the tree of life, their long lifespan, and their homeland. Now relegated to the frozen north, they strive to prevent history from repeating itself.*

### :material-sleep-off: Trance
Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice.
