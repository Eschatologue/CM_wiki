"Once a revered race, the elves commanded respect across Antares. Yet, they fell from grace, losing their ancient forest, their ties to the tree of life, their long lifespan, and their homeland. Now relegated to the frozen north, they strive to prevent history from repeating itself."

## Elf Traits

### Main Traits

:material-arrow-up-bold-box:{ .lg .middle } **Ability Score Improvement**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; One of your ability score increases by 2, and one of your ability score increases by 1.

:material-rotate-right:{ .lg .middle } **Age**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 75 and can live to be 350 years old.

:dnd-trait-size:{ .lg .middle }  **Size**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is **Medium**

:rsc-speed:{ .lg .middle } **Speed**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You are considered to have *Standard* speed; which is 30 ft.

:dnd-stat-lang:{ .lg .middle } **Languages**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You can speak, read, and write *Common* and *Elvish*.

### Additional Traits

:dnd-trait-darkvision:{ .lg .middle } **Darkvision**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You can see in the dark up to 60 ft.

:simple-paloaltonetworks:{ .lg .middle } **Fey Ancestry**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You have :d20-adv: **Advantage** on :die-d20:**Saving Throws** against being Charmed and magic can't put you to Sleep and you can easily identify whenever an elf is wood elf, high elf, or a drow just by looking at it. Except when they hide themselves through magical means.

:material-wrench:{ .lg .middle } **Keen Sense**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; You have :dnd-stat-prof:**Proficiency** in the Wisdom (Perception) skill.

:material-sleep-off:{ .lg .middle } **Trance**  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

> If you meditate during a Long Rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a Long Rest; only the duration is changed.

## Drow
*Long before the ancient forest burned to ashes, you have been driven to the Underdark. Most drow have adopted a ruthless pragmatism since then. Though the underdark was once a hellish place, now a bustling civilisation, their inherent nature of mistrust remains.*

## High Elf
*Once heirs to the Ancient Forest, high elves are masters of spellcraft and naturally talented wordsmiths. Though your people's misdeeds in the past and the severed connections between your race and the Tree of Life may not have been your fault, it is an original sin that you must carry, whether you want to or not.*
