"Once a revered race, the elves commanded respect across Antares. Yet, they fell from grace, losing their ancient forest, their ties to the tree of life, their long lifespan, and their homeland. Now relegated to the frozen north, they strive to prevent history from repeating itself."

One of your Ability Score increases by 2, and one of your Ability Score increases by 1.

#### :material-rotate-right: Age

Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 75 and can live to be 350 years old.

#### :trait-size: Size

Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is **Medium**

#### :rsc-speed: Base Racial Speed

You are considered to have ^^Standard^^ speed; which is 30 ft.

#### :simple-paloaltonetworks: Fey Ancestry

You have :d20-adv: Advantage** on :d20-save: Saving Throws** against being Charmed and magic can't put you to Sleep. You can easily identify whenever an elf is wood elf, high elf, or a drow just by looking at it. Except when they hide themselves through magical means.

#### :material-wrench: Keen Sense

You have :trait-prof: **Proficiency** in the Wisdom (Perception) skill.

#### :material-sleep-off: Trance

Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance." 

While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.

> If you meditate during a Long Rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a Long Rest; only the duration is changed.
