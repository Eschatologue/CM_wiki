# Creating Your Character

This D&D campaign setting uses the same rulings as what you would find in other settings with minor additions and modifications. On a notable note, it uses combinations of 5th Edition ruling and OneD&D ruling.

## Understanding The Core Principles

When creating your character, you must adhere to three core principles that apply at all times, both during roleplaying and gameplay.

### Team Cooperation

**Your character must consistently work with and support the rest of the party.**

A rogue who steals from party members or sabotages plans undermines group cohesion. Instead, create a rogue who uses their skills to benefit the party, like scouting ahead, gathering intelligence, or disarming traps to ensure safe passage for the group. Another example is a bard who not only performs to inspire allies but also uses their charm and wit to negotiate and forge alliances that benefit the entire party.

### Plot Engagement

**Your character must be consistently willing to engage with the campaign’s plot.**

A character who refuses to participate in the main quest or constantly separates from the group disrupts the story. Instead, design a character with personal motivations that align with the campaign’s goals, such as a ranger seeking revenge on the antagonist responsible for the apocalypse or a cleric on a mission to restore order and help survivors. These motivations should naturally lead the character to be involved in key events and conflicts of the campaign.

### Setting and Tone

**Your character must plausibly fit into the campaign’s setting and align with the overall tone of the campaign.**
 
This setting uses a post-apocalyptic dystopian science fantasy world, characters should blend modern and fantasy elements. A traditional medieval knight would be out of place. Instead, create a knight equipped armour combining modern technology enchanted with ancient runes. Similarly, a mage might use arcane spells alongside gadgets, and a ranger could be adept at surviving in both urban ruins and wild wastelands, utilizing a mix of traditional skills and contemporary tools.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Choose a Race

Crown & Misery uses Common races available in 2014 PHB, with a lot of alterations. They are **9** available races for you to choose from.

### Choose a Background

A Background represents your character's past and what push them to pursue the adventuring way of life. See the article [here](background.md) for more details.

### Choosing a Class

*Main Article: [Classes](../class/index.md)*

Please choose a class from the available options listed.

You can also choose to [Multiclass](../character-creation/multiclassing.md) when the prerequisites are met.

### Starting Ability Scores

In this setting, we uses the Standard Array as follow: `15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8`

Simply assign one number to each ability score (one to Strength, one to Dexterity, one to Constitution, and so on). Then, you'll be able to determine your character's modifier for each score.

#### Ability Scores

*Main Article: [Ability Score](../character-creation/ability-scores/index.md)*

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Because ability modifiers affect almost every :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**, :d20-check: **Ability Check**, and :d20-save: **Saving Throw**, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

#### Ability Scores and Modifiers Table

| SCORE | MODIFIER | SCORE | MODIFIER |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

??? tip "Optimization"

    This DnD setting emphasizes character optimization, so it's crucial to seek advice or research how to best allocate your starting stats for your character concept and for its class. Properly optimized stats can greatly enhance your gameplay experience and ensure your character excels in their chosen role.

    While following the meta isn't mandatory, it's important not to mishandle your ability scores.

### Starting Level

For this campaign, you will start at Level 3

When making your character, make one normally starting at Level 1, and then treat it as you levelled up twice to Level 3. Some class feature grants additional benefits or even subclass choice at 3rd-level, so keep that in mind
