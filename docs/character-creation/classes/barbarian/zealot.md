# Barbarian: Zealot

***For Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot, their Rage is not merely a connection to nature; it is a gift from a god. These Barbarians often experience their Rage as an ecstatic experience of union with their gods, infusing them with divine power to pursue the gods’ purposes in the world.***

## Level 3: Divine Fury

You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.

## Level 3: Warrior of the Gods

A divine entity helps ensure you can continue to fight. When a spell or magic item restores any of your Hit Points, you can roll a d12 and regain additional Hit Points equal to the number rolled. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

In addition, if a spell, such as the [Raise Dead] spell, has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn’t need Material components to cast the spell on you.

## Level 6: Fanatical Focus

If you fail a saving throw while your Rage is active, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this feature only once per active Rage.

## Level 10: Zealous Presence

As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. If you’ve run out of uses of this feature, you can expend a use of your Rage to activate Zealous Presence instead of Rage.

## Level 14: Rage Beyond Death

When your Relentless Rage successfully restores your Hit Points, you can assume the form of a spectral warrior. While in this form, you gain the following benefits:

- You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain, but you take 1d10 Force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.
- When you’re hit by an attack roll, you can use your Reaction to turn that hit into a miss.
The form lasts for 1 minute or until you regain any Hit Points or drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
