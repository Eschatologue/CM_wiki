# Gnome

Gnome are magical folk created by gods of invention, illusions, and live underground. The earliest gnomes were seldom seen by other folk due to the gnomes' secretive nature and their propensity for living in forests and burrows. What they lacked in size, they made up for in cleverness. They confounded predators with traps and labyrinthine tunnels. 

Gnomes are petite folk with big eyes and pointed ears, who live around 425 years. Many gnomes like the feeling of roof over their head, even if that "roof: is nothing more than a hat.

#### Forest Gnome

You know the Minor Illusion cantrio. You also always have the Speak with Animals spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended use when you finish a Long Rest. You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.

#### Rock Gnome

You know the Mending and Prestidigitation cantrips. In addition, you can spen 10 minutes casting Prestidigitation cantrip to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has option within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both.

You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a Utilise action.
