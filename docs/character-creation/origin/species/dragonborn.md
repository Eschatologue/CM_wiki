# Dragonborn

--8<-- "docs/character-creation/origin/species/index.md:species-warning"

A proud race, prioritizing clan loyalty and individual prowess above all else. Their existence is sculpted by Aeginaes and then placed under servitude for their creator, acting as their executors, leading to their fear and ostracization by other races. Determined to maintain independence and self-sufficiency, they refuse to be indebted to anyone, including once the Gods, and now, the Spires.
