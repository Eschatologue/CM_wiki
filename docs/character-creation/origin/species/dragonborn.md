# Dragonborn

The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods' blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragons—scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their heads—and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.

**Area of Effect**{ .inl } A Breath Weapon attack targets an area of a **15 ft. :aoe-cone: Cone** or a **5 by 30 ft. :aoe-line: Line** (choose the shape each time), originating from you. 

**Saving Throw**{ .inl } A Breath Weapon attack forces a Dexterity saving throw at its targets. The DC is equals 8 + your Constitution Modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. Targets still takes half damage on a successful Save.

During that time, you have Fly Speed equal to your **:rsc-spd: Speed**{ .em }.

Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a **:rest-long: Long Rest**.

## Lore

--8<-- "docs/character-creation/origin/species/index.md:species-warning"

Dragonborn are a proud species, valuing clan loyalty and personal prowess above all else. Their origins trace back to the ancient Aeginae progenitor, whose name has been lost to history. Aeginae sculpted the Dragonborn from its own scales, creating them as a race of executors bound to serve their creator. This bond led to a long history of fear and ostracisation from other races.

Now, with the Aeginae all but extinct, the Dragonborn remain resolute in their desire for independence. Determined to maintain self-sufficiency, they refuse to owe allegiance to anyone—not even the gods, and certainly not the Spires.

Most Dragonborn are found either aboard the Karakorum Arks or in Soterrano, where they live between 80 to 100 years. Their physical traits make them uniquely suited to harsh environments, where other species might perish. While they are often perceived as intimidating or gruff by unfamiliar races, a Dragonborn's greatest gift to an ally is their unwavering loyalty. Their sense of humour is equally dry, no matter where they are from.
