"Half-Orcs are creatures of intense emotion, more inclined to act than contemplate. Whether the rage burning in their bodies compels them to fight or the love filling their hearts inspires acts of incredible kindness, their emotions drive them to action."

## Subrace

### Continental Half-Orc

*Continental Orcs, also known as ogres, often face disdain from dwarves for reasons that remain unclear. Marriages between humans and orcs have led to the birth of half-orcs. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, leveraging their human blood for an advantage over their full-blooded orc rivals. The majority of half-orcs found in Antares trace their ancestry back to these groups.*
