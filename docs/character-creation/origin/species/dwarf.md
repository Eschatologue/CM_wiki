# Dwarf

Once divided among kingdoms and clans, ensnared in the Age of Strife and manipulated by high-elves, the dwarves now stand united under a single federation. Known for their endurance, resilience and grudges, they excel as warriors, miners, and smiths.

Dwarves were raised from the earth and that gave dwarves an affinity for stone and metal and for living underground. This also made them resilient like the mountains, with a life span of about 350 years.

***Hill Dwarves***  
Also called 'Gold Dwarves', known for their confidence and intuition. They has a keen interest in family values, ancient dwarven ritual, and fine craftsmanship. They are responsible of uniting all the fractured Dwarven clans under the single federation during the age of strife, though they rarely take credits of this.

***Mountain Dwarves***  
Also known as 'Shield Dwarves', they are strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain and probably on the tall side (for a dwarf). They have a very strong martial tradition, resulting in a majority of Myrkheim's main army originating from this particulars subrace of dwarves.
