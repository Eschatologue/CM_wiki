# Character Species

When you choose your character's species, you determine whether your character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn or gnome.

The peoples of the D&D multiverse hail from different worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms. A player character's species is the set of game traits that an adventurer gains from being one of those life forms.

Some species can trace their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species' genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to many different cultures.

Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in this chapter. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn't beyond their species' normal life span.

## Parts of a Species

A species includes the following parts.

***Creature Type.*** A character's species determines the character's creature type, which is described in the rules glossary. Every species in this chapter is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in other D&D books.

***Size.*** Your character's species determines the character's size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium.

***Speed.*** Your character's species determines the character's Speed.

***Special Traits.*** Each species gives a character special traitsâ€”unique characteristics based on the species' physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options.

## Race Changes in Crown & Misery

Crown & Misery introduces changes to the original races from the PHB and TCE to better fit the world settings. This is not an exhaustive list.

### Lore

Some races' lore has been slightly altered in Crown & Misery. For example, while elves traditionally live in forests, in this world, they "used to." Feel free to ask the DM for more details regarding the lore behind the races for reference when creating your backgrounds.

### Innate Expertise

Some races allow you to apply double your Proficiency Bonus on checks in highly specific situations. These have been slightly altered, either by simplifying the situations or by granting the associated Proficiencies directly.

### Dragonborn's Breath Weapon

In the PHB, Dragonborn have a myriad of ancestry options. In Crown & Misery, this has been restricted to a few, but now Dragonborn can choose the area of effect for their breath weapon (cone or line) at will, instead of having these options restricted to specific ancestries.

### Sunlight Sensitivity

Sunlight Sensitivity has been removed. The night is lethal in Antares, and it would be an inconvenience in most situations. However, feel free to roleplay your Drow character wearing sunglasses and using sunscreen at all times.
