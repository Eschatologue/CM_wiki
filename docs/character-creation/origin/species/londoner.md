# Londoner

The Londoners arrived from beyond Antares through the Northern Gate, bringing with them their ingenuity, advanced technology, and strong ideologies. Highly intelligent and deeply nationalistic, these humans have a mysterious past, their will tempered by constant warfare and perpetual threats to their existenceâ€”a reality that persists even in Antares.

??? info "Why Restriction?"

    Humans from the Albion are outsiders in Antares. As a result, the Weave of magic does not interact with them in the same way it does with the native races, rendering them unable to perform direct spellcraft. However, a small number of Londoners have found ways to wield magic, often through the use of technological innovations, casting units, or ancient artifacts that contain magical properties.
