# Londoner

The Londoners arrived from beyond Antares through the Northern Gate, bringing with them their ingenuity, advanced technology, and strong ideologies. Highly intelligent and deeply nationalistic, these humans have a mysterious past, their will tempered by constant warfare and perpetual threats to their existenceâ€”a reality that persists even in Antares.

!!! warning "Class Restriction"

    Humans from the London lineage are outsiders to the continent of Antares. As a result, the Weave of magic does not interact with them in the same way it does with the native races, rendering them unable to perform direct spellcraft. However, a small number of Londoners have found ways to wield magic, often through the use of technological innovations, casting units, or ancient artifacts that contain magical properties.

    When you choose this race, you are restricted from the **Bard**, **Cleric**, **Druid**, **Sorcerer**, and **Wizard** classes.
