# Elf

Once a revered race, the elves commanded respect across Antares. Yet, they fell from grace, losing their ancient forest, their ties to the tree of life; severing their lifespan to only around 400 years, and also their homeland. Now relegated to the frozen north, they strive to prevent history from repeating itself.

***Drow***  
Long before the ancient forest burned to ashes, you have been driven to the Underdark. Most drow have adopted a ruthless pragmatism since then. Though the underdark was a hellish place no more, their inherent nature of mistrust remains.

***High Elf***  
Once heirs to the Ancient Forest, high elves are masters of spellcraft and naturally talented wordsmiths. Though your people's misdeeds in the past and the severed connections between your race and the Tree of Life may not have been your fault, it is an original sin that you must carry.

Outside of your own race, looks of contempt, hatred, and extreme prejudice are the norm for you. The world is not kind to anyone, especially you.

***Wood Elf***  
Your kind once tended to the beautiful and lush Ancient Forest. Now, your once slender hands are now covered in soot and calloused from tending to the Generator; the only thing keeping you and your people from being frozen and buried under the snow of the Antares' northern waste.

Centuries of training and natural talent in archery and camouflage in the forest have proven to be suprisingly useful skills in Arctic environment.
