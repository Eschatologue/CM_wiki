# Background

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?

## Parts of a Background

Your character's background is the collection of characteristics that they picked up during the formative years of their life. These are the experiences and occupations your character engaged in separate from their upbringing and species, and prior to their life as an adventurer.

Each background includes a brief narrative of what your character's past might have been like. Alter the details of this narrative however you like.

Mechanically, your background contains six aspects detailed as follow:

1. **Ability Scores:** Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20. 

2. **Feat:** A background gives your character a specified Origin feat that best represents a talent your character developed or had while living this portion of their life.

3. **Skill Proficiencies:** Your background grants you Proficiency in two specified skills.

4. **Tool Proficiency:** Each background gives a character proficiency with one toolâ€”either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan's Tools category.

5. **Equipment:** The equipment that your character starts with. You can either choose any equipment package available to any background from the 2014 PHB, or you start with 500 SP instead to spend on the equipment of your choice; this can be a combination of Weapon, Tools, Clothing, a Bedroll, etc.

6. **Affiliation:** You have 5 point to spend between 4 [Affiliation](#affiliation); Academe, Bohemia, Establishment, Villainny. Affiliation is what connects your character pasts to their presents.

### The Common Background

These backgrounds are available as part as the new 2024 PHB, these options act as an example of what kind of past your character might have during their time before their journey, you are of course free to came up with your own twist or an orignal idea of what kinds of past your character might have.

|---|---|
| Acolyte | You were a devoted servant in a place of worship. You learned the rituals of your faith and how to channel divine power as part of your service. |
| Charlatan | You have learned to seek out a mark in taverns and pubs, and find the people most in search of less than honest goods, such as forgeries or sham magic items. |
| Artisan | You worked your way up from scrubbing floors to an apprenticeship creating your own crafts. You know how to schmooze a customer and have a keen eye for detail. |
| Criminal | Whether you were a member of a criminal crew or a solo thief who only looked out for yourself, you know the best ways to slice some purse strings or how to find alternative means to enter a locked shop. |
| Entertainer | You've spent your life on either a literal or proverbial stage, performing for willing audiences. You have learned how to channel your talent for creation into a crowd-pleasing art form. |
| Guard | You've put in your time standing watch over a city or location. You've had your head on a swivel, keeping a watchful eye on raiding enemies on one side of a wall or criminal elements on the other. |
| Farmer | You've tilled the soil or raised animals as livestock or to aid you in cultivating your fields. You've gained a healthy respect for nature, in both its bounty and its wrath. |
| Guide | Your life was mostly spent outdoors, exploring the natural wonders around you. In your travels, you learned the basics of how to channel the magic of the wild world around you. |
| Hermit | Whether alone in a hut or as part of a monastery, you've spent a considerable amount of time outside the trappings of society. You've grown comfortable pondering the wonders and mysteries of creation. |
| Noble | You grew up in the opulence and structure of wealth and societal privilege. You may have bristled against the restrictions and expectations of your role, but you learned a lot about courtly intrigue and the skills of leadership. |
| Merchant | As an apprentice to a trader or shopkeeper, you traveled either supplying artisans with the materials they needed or acquiring their goods to sell to your customers. You know how to make a deal and how to handle a long journey. |
| Sage | Your thirst for knowledge drew you to some of the greatest libraries and archives in the world. You've got a knack for research and perhaps a rudimentary knowledge of magic gleaned from a book or two. |
| Sailor | You called the open water your home, survived some of the sea's harshest storms. You've swapped stories with the best of them, whether that's on the barstool of a random port or the denizens of the world beneath the waves. |
| Soldier | You can hardly remember a time when you didn't wield a weapon. You're well-versed in the ways of battle and war to protect the realm, and you have the muscle memory to prove it. |
| Scribe | The written word has been your domain, either copying tomes, crafting government documents, or producing your own texts. Your eye for detail and ability to catch errors and mistakes is finely honed. |
| Wayfarer | An urchin or societal castoff, you learned to survive. Forging your own path on the streets and possibly turning to crime when needed, you've managed to keep your pride and hope that destiny has more for you yet. |

The backstory can be as simple or as elaborate as you like, but please keep it grounded under the [Three Core Principles](index.md#understanding-the-core-principles).
