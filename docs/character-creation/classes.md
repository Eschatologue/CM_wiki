# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

## Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common.

## Subclasses

When a character reaches a certain level in a class they must select a subclass. The level that this choice is made at varies from class to class.

Subclasses allow characters to further specialize their character by imparting powerful new abilities focused around enhancing the central theme of the subclass. Choosing a subclass does not cause a character to stop gaining the normal benefits of a class when advancing in level - the benefits of a subclass are on top of the normal class abilities.

## Multiclassing

*Main Article: [Multiclassing](/CM_wiki/gameplay/multiclassing)*

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.
