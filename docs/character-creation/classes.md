# Classes

A character's class in D&D is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling and offers a unique set of abilities, powers, and skills that influence how the character interacts with the world. Classes determine most of a character's capabilities, both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels within a class, they gain incredible new powers and abilities, shaping their journey and role in the adventure.

## Class Groups

Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common.

## Subclasses

When a character reaches a certain level in a class they must select a subclass. The level that this choice is made at varies from class to class.

Subclasses allow characters to further specialize their character by imparting powerful new abilities focused around enhancing the central theme of the subclass. Choosing a subclass does not cause a character to stop gaining the normal benefits of a class when advancing in level - the benefits of a subclass are on top of the normal class abilities.

## Multiclassing

*Main article: [Multiclassing](/CM_wiki/gameplay/multiclassing)*

Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

## Playable Classes

### :material-hammer-wrench:{ .lg .middle } Artificer

*"Rare kind of spellcaster who treated magic in the same manner as a mason might see a chisel as a tool for the creation of marvels."*

An artificer learned to wield their magic through the mastering of sigils and diagrams or combining technologies and traditional magic, as well as using magical ingredients. Artificers infused objects of the world, be they inanimate or alive, with the power of the arcane, making them both powerful crafters and healers.

### :material-axe-battle:{ .lg .middle } Barbarian

*"The strong embrace the wild that hides inside - keen instincts, primal physicality, and most of all, an unbridled, unquenchable rage."*

Barbarians were mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence, and on some occasions, excessive calm and reason. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly.

### :material-guitar-acoustic:{ .lg .middle } Bard

*"You know music is more than a fancy - it is power. Through study and adventure, you have mastered song, speech, and the magic within."*

Bards are versatile arcane spellcasters, capable in combat, art, and magic alike. Bards practiced magic as they would art or song, using their artistic talents to induce magical effects that either bolstered their allies or hindered their enemies, typically through charms and illusions. 

In addition to their magical skills, bards were artistically talented and extraordinarily well-learned, possessing knowledge in a wide range of fields. Bards were among the most versatile of adventurers, capable of learning from practically any trade.

### :material-cross-celtic:{ .lg .middle } Cleric

*"Clerics are representatives of the gods they worship, wielding potent divine magic for good or ill."*

A cleric was once a divine servant of one or more gods, serving them with martial might and divine magic fueled by their own strength of faith. As agents of a divine authority, clerics were empowered both by ritual training and their god's particular favor. Relatively rare, clerics inspired both reverence and terror, depending on their aims and who they served. 

Nowadays, the deities of the past have been absorbed and replaced by Spires. While recent clerics are closer to representatives of an Ascent they stride in, some clerics still worship these past gods.

### :material-leaf:{ .lg .middle } Druid

*Druids channel the elemental forces of nature and share a deep kinship with animals. Mastery of Wild Shape allows them to transform into beasts and otherworldy beings."*

Druids were primal spellcasters of considerable power and versatility, who gained their power through being at one with nature or through a connection to a powerful deity or nature spirit or even cosmic entities. Guardians of the wilderness, druids saw themselves less as masters of the natural order and more as an extension of its will.
