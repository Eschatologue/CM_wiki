# Eldritch Invocations

This page contains a comprehensive list of all Eldritch Invocations. Several invocations have been slightly modified to align with the Crown & Misery campaign, as detailed below:

***Spellcasting Modifier Adjustments.*** Certain Warlock invocations have been altered to use the player's spellcasting modifier instead of Charisma.

***Prerequisite Changes.*** Some invocation prerequisites have been removed, allowing players with the Eldritch Initiate feat to select those invocations.

Note that the specific invocations affected by these changes are not listed.
