# Eldritch Invocations

This page contains a comprehensive list of all Eldritch Invocations. Several invocations have been slightly modified to align with the Crown & Misery campaign, as detailed below:

***Spellcasting Modifier Adjustments.*** Certain Warlock invocations have been altered to use the player's spellcasting modifier instead of Charisma.

***Prerequisite Changes.*** Some invocation prerequisites have been removed, allowing players with the Eldritch Initiate feat to select those invocations.

Note that the specific invocations affected by these changes are not listed.

The table below lists available General Feats, divided into three categories: *PHB '24*, *Supplemental*, and *Homebrew*.
