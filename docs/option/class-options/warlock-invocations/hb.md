### Pact of the Chalice

You can conjure a Pact Chalice; a vessel for the creation of potions and poultices in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. It takes the form of of a tiny object of your choice that is capable of holding liquids, and it grants you the following benefits:

***Tools.*** It counts as both a Herbalism Kit and a Alchemist's Supplies, and it uses your Spellcasting modifier for ability checks made with it.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use the device as a Spellcasting Focus.

***Potion Creation.*** At the end of a Short or Long Rest, you can use the Pact Chalice to conjure a vial of the following: [Alchemist's Fire], [Acid], [Holy Water], [Potion of Healing], or [Potion of Climbing]. The liquid retains its potency until the end of your next long rest, at which point it becomes inert and unusable.

This timekeeping device disappears if you conjure another device with this feature or if you die.
