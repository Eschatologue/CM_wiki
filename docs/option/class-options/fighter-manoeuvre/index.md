# Combat Manoeuvre

Combat Manoeuvres are special tactical actions available to Fighters who choose the Battle Master subclass or other subclass that allows them to use these manoeuvre. These manoeuvres allow a creature to influence the battlefield by using precise, strategic techniques in combat. The manoeuvres are fuelled by superiority dice, which are limited in number and represent the class' ability to perform these actions.

**Prerequisite**{ .inl } If a Manoeuvre have a prerequisite, you must meet any prerequisite specified to have that Manoeuvre.

**Saving Throw**{ .inl } If a manoeuvre you use requires your target to make a :d20-save: Saving Throw to resist the manoeuvre's effects, the DC equals 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).
