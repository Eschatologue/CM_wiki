## TCE Infusions

Below are Artificer's Infusion available from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.

### Armour of Magical Strength

*Prerequisite: A suit of armour (requires attunement)*

This armour has 6 charges. The wearer can expend the armour's charges in the following ways:

- When the wearer makes a Strength check or a Strength saving throw, it can expend 1 charge to add a bonus to the roll equal to its Intelligence modifier.
- The creature can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge to end the Prone condition.

The armour regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

While holding this item, a creature gains a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores Half Cover when making a spell attack.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach level 10 in this class.

### Homunculus Servant

*Prerequisite: A gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp*

You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special **homunculus** that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.

You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a Bonus Action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the *mending* spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

    **HP** 1 + your Intelligence modifier + your artificer level (the homunculus has a number of Hit Dice [d4s] equal to your artificer level)

    #### Traits

    ***Evasion.*** If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's incapacitated.  

    #### Actions (Requires Your Bonus Action)

### Replicate Magic Item

Using this infusion, you replicate a particular magic item. You can learn this infusion multiple times; each time you do so, choose a magic item that you can make with it, picking from the Replicable Items tables below. A table's title tells you the level you must be in the class to choose an item from the table. Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls.

In the tables, an item's entry tells you whether the item requires attunement. See the item's description in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for more information about it, including the type of object required for its making.
