### Careful Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### Distant Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to double the spell's range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to make the spell's range 30 feet.

### Empowered Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Extended Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have **:d20-adv: Advantage**{.d20} on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

### Heightened Spell :ui-sorc-point::ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend **2 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to give one target of the spell **:d20-dis: Disadvantage**{.d20} on saves against the spell.

---

### Quickened Spell :ui-sorc-point::ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an **:rsc-a: Action**{.rsc}, you can spend **2 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to change the casting time to a **:rsc-b: Bonus Action**{.rsc} for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

---

### Seeking Spell :ui-sorc-point:

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

### Subtle Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

### Transmuted Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: **:dmg-acid: Acid**{.dmg-acid}, **:dmg-cold: Cold**{.dmg-cold}, **:dmg-fire: Fire**{.dmg-fire}, **:dmg-lgtn: Lightning**{.dmg-lgtn}, **:dmg-posn: Poison**{.dmg-posn}, **:dmg-thun: Thunder**{.dmg-thun}.

### Twinned Spell :ui-sorc-point:

When you cast a spell, such as [:spell-lv1: Charm Person], that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend **1 :ui-sorc-point: Sorcery Point(s)** to increase the spell's effective level by 1.
