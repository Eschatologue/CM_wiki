# Metamagic

Metamagic options allow you to change how you cast spells, their effects, range, duration, and other aspects.

This page contains a list of all Sorcerer's Metamagic. Several metamagic have been slightly modified to align with the Crown & Misery campaign, as detailed below:

***Spellcasting Modifier Adjustments.*** Certain Metamagic have been altered to use the player's spellcasting modifier instead of Charisma.

Note that the specific metamagic affected by these changes are not listed.
