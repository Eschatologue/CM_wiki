### Dual-Focused {.noborder}

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

<hr class="hr-solid">  

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

**Manifest power**
:   If you attempt to cast a spell that requires **:spell-conc: Concentration** while already Concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain Concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must take a **:rsc-a: Magic**{.rsc} action on each subsequent round on maintaining this Concentration, or lose it for both spells.
    
**Burden**
:   At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are **:spell-conc: Concentration** on, you must make a **:d20-save: CON Save**{.d20} (`DC 10 + both spells' levels combined`). On a failure, you lose **:spell-conc: Concentration** for both spells. You can end Concentration on one of your spells during your turn to avoid this save.

Any time you would be forced to make a **:d20-save: CON Save**{.d20} to maintain **:spell-conc: Concentration** due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On fail, you lose **:spell-conc: Concentration** on both spells

!!! glossary "Interactions"

    The **Improved Critical** and **Fatal Magic** features do not interact with each other. **Improved Critical** applies only to attack rolls, while **Fatal Magic** applies only to spells that require saving throws. Additionally, any effect that reduces the number needed to roll for a Critical Hit does not apply to **Fatal Magic**.

    However, if you have a feature that triggers on a Critical Hit (such as rolling additional dice or applying another effect), **Fatal Magic** will activate this effect when it doubles the spell's damage.
