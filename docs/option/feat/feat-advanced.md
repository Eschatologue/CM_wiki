### Dual-Focused

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

**Manifest power**{ .inl }  
If you attempt to cast a spell that requires Concentration while already Concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain Concentration on both spells simultaneously.

**Burden**{ .inl }  
At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are Concentrating on, you must make a :d20-save: Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined). On a failure, you lose Concentration for both spells. You can end Concentration on one of your spells during your turn to avoid this save.

Any time you would be forced to make a Concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On fail, you lose Concentration on both spells

??? glossary "One Spell Slot Per Turn"

    In 2024 Player's Handbook, the rule for spellcasting has been altered as follow:

    ---

    ***One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn***
    --8<-- "docs/spells/casting-spells.md:one-spell-per-turn"

### Spell Executioner

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Your spells become especially lethal against unsuspecting foes.

**Improved Critical**{ .inl }  
The number you need to roll for Critical Hit with spells is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.

**Fatal Magic**{ .inl }  
When a creature's saving throw result on the d20 is equal or lower than your Proficiency Bonus against one of your spells, the spell's initial damage is doubled. This is treated as a Critical Hit for gameplay purposes.

??? glossary "Interactions"

    The **Improved Critical** and **Fatal Magic** features do not interact with each other. **Improved Critical** applies only to attack rolls, while **Fatal Magic** applies only to spells that require saving throws. Additionally, any effect that reduces the number needed to roll for a Critical Hit does not apply to **Fatal Magic**.

    However, if you have a feature that triggers on a Critical Hit (such as rolling additional dice or applying another effect), **Fatal Magic** will activate this effect when it doubles the spell's damage.
