### Ambidexterous

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Strength or Dexterity 15+, [Two-weapon Fighting](./feat-fighting-style/phb24.md#two-weapon-fighting) feat)*

You learn to wield even more weapon variety with both of your hands.

**Bonus AC**

**Flurry**  
When you make the extra off-hand attack using the :weapon-prop-light: **Light** property, you can make it as part of the Attack action, instead of as a Bonus Action. You can still make this extra attack only once per turn.

**Quick Draw**  
You can draw or stow two weapons that lack the :weapon-prop-two-handed: **Two-Handed** property when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Extra Attack feature)*

### Dual-Focused

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

**Manifest power**  
If you attempt to cast a spell that requires Concentration while already Concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain Concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must take a Magic action on each subsequent round on maintaining this Concentration, or lose it for both spells.
    
**Burden**  
At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are Concentrating on, you must make a :d20-save: Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined). On a failure, you lose Concentration for both spells. You can end Concentration on one of your spells during your turn to avoid this save.

Any time you would be forced to make a Concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On fail, you lose Concentration on both spells

You can't benefit from a Feat's feature that grants increase to ability scores (e.g [Ability Score Improvement](./feat-general/phb24.md#ability-scores-improvement)). All other rules related to gaining Feats still apply. Replacing this Feat will forgo all the General Feats gained from this Feat.

**Repeatable**

### Shield Prodigy

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, [Shield Warrior](../feat/feat-fighting-style/hb.md#shield-warrior) feat)*

Through meticulous refinement and tinkering of your equipment, you gain unique abilities with shields. **While wielding a Shield**, you gain the following benefits:

**Damage Reduction**  
When a creature you can see hits you *or* an ally within 5 feet of you with an attack roll, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** to reduce the damage dealt equals your Proficiency Bonus.

**Shield Expert**  
A shield has the :weapon-prop-thrown: **Thrown (30/60)** property and has the Topple and Push Mastery property for you. You can only use one Mastery property per attack. Whether a Ranged attack with a shield hits or misses, the shield bounces back to you harmlessly.

**Transforming Shield**  
As a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, while wielding both a shield and a melee weapon, you can combine the two, transforming the weapon. The melee weapon gains the :weapon-prop-two-handed: **Two-handed** property and deals extra damage the Shield's Damage on Hit. You lose the Shield’s AC bonus in this form. 

You can take a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action** to end this transformation, reverting both the weapon and shield, to its original form.

### Spelldriver

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Through intense focus, training, and dedication, you've harnessed the techniques of rapid spellcasting.

**Rapid Spellcasting**  
On a turn, when you expend a spell slot to cast a spell, you can still expend a level 3 spell slot or lower to cast another spell.

!!! tip "One Spell Slot Per Turn"

    In 2024 Player's Handbook, the rule for spellcasting has been altered as follow:

    ***One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn***
    --8<-- "docs/spells/casting-spells.md:one-spell-per-turn"

    ---

    This feat lifts that restriction, but the level of spell slot you can expend is still limited to only level 3.
    
---

### Spell Executioner

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Your spells become especially lethal against unsuspecting foes.

**Improved Critical**  
The number you need to roll for Critical Hit with spells is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.

**Fatal Magic**  
When a creature's saving throw result on the d20 is equal or lower than your Proficiency Bonus against one of your spells, the spell's initial damage is doubled. This is treated as a Critical Hit for gameplay purposes.

!!! tip "Interactions"

    The **Improved Critical** and **Fatal Magic** features do not interact with each other. **Improved Critical** applies only to attack rolls, while **Fatal Magic** applies only to spells that require saving throws. Additionally, any effect that reduces the number needed to roll for a Critical Hit does not apply to **Fatal Magic**.

    However, if you have a feature that triggers on a Critical Hit (such as rolling additional dice or applying another effect), **Fatal Magic** will activate this effect when it doubles the spell's damage.

### Theurgy

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 15+)*

You learn how to channel divine power given by the divine.
    
**Channel Divinity**  
Choose one Channel Divinity option from a Cleric or Paladin subclass. You can use this Channel Divinity once per Short Rest and it uses your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose one) modifier for it.

**Repeatable**  
Pick a different Channel Divinity option from a different Cleric or Paladin domain each time.
