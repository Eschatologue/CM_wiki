### Dual-Focused

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Countless hours have been spent training your mind to maintain focus on concurrent incantations, taxing as the process may be.

**Manifest power**  
If you attempt to cast a spell that requires Concentration while already Concentrating on an existing spell, you can maintain Concentration on both spells simultaneously. You must take a Magic action on each subsequent round on maintaining this Concentration, or lose it for both spells.
    
**Burden**  
At the end of each turn where you have two spells you are Concentrating on, you must make a :d20-save: Constitution saving throw (DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined). On a failure, you lose Concentration for both spells. You can end Concentration on one of your spells during your turn to avoid this save.

Any time you would be forced to make a Concentration due to taking damage, the DC equals 10 + both spells' levels combined, or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. On fail, you lose Concentration on both spells

### Shield Prodigy

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, [Shield Warrior](../feat/feat-fighting-style/hb.md#shield-warrior) feat)*

Through meticulous refinement and tinkering of your equipment, you gain unique abilities with shields. **While wielding a Shield**, you gain the following benefits:

**Damage Reduction**  
When a creature you can see hits you *or* an ally within 5 feet of you with an attack roll, you can take a :rsc-r: **Reaction** to reduce the damage dealt by a number of d4s equal to the AC granted by the shield. (e.g A regular Shield (+2 AC) would grants 2d4 damage reduction)

**Shield Expert**  
A shield has the :weapon-prop-thrown: **Thrown (30/60)** property and has the Topple and Push Mastery property for you. You can only use one Mastery property per attack. Whether a Ranged attack with a shield hits or misses, the shield bounces back to you harmlessly.

**Transforming Shield**  
As a :rsc-b: **Bonus Action**, while wielding both a shield and a melee weapon, you can combine the two, transforming the weapon. The melee weapon gains the :weapon-prop-two-handed: **Two-handed** property and deals additional damage equal to the shield’s damage die. You lose the shield’s AC bonus in this form. 

You can take a :rsc-b: Bonus Action to end this transformation, reverting both the weapon and shield, to its original form.

### Spelldriver

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature)*

Through intense focus, training, and dedication, you've harnessed the techniques of rapid spellcasting.

**Rapid Spellcasting**  
On a turn, when you expend a spell slot to cast a spell, you can still expend a level 3 spell slot or lower to cast another spell.

??? tip "One Spell Slot Per Turn"

    In 2024 Player's Handbook, the rule for spellcasting has been altered as follow:

    ***One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn.***
    --8<-- "docs/spells/casting-spells.md:one-spell-per-turn"

    ---

    This feat lifts that restriction, but the level of spell slot you can expend is still limited to only level 3.
    
---

### Theurgy

*Advanced Feat (Prerequisites: Level 8+, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 15+)*

**Channel Divinity**  
Choose a Cleric subclass, you gain a level 3 feature of that subclass that expend a use of Channel Divinity. You can use this feature once per Short Rest. If a Channel Divinity option uses Wisdom of its effect, you can use either your Intelligence or Charisma for it.

**Repeatable**  
Pick a different Channel Divinity option from a different Cleric domain each time.
