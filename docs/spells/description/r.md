# Spells (R)
Raise Dead

Level 5 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 500+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no longer than 10 days and it wasn’t Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with 1 Hit Point. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

Ray of Enfeeblement

Level 2 Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Tests for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts 1d8 from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

Ray of Frost
Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 Cold damage, and its Speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

Regenerate

Level 7 Transmutation (Bard, Cleric, Druid)

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

A creature you touch regains 4d8 + 15 Hit Points. For the duration, the target regains 1 Hit Point at the start of each of its turns, and any severed body parts regrow after 2 minutes.

Reincarnate

Level 5 Necromancy (Druid)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead Humanoid or a piece of one. If the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new body for it and calls the soul to enter that body. Roll 1d10 and consult the table below to determine the body’s species, or the DM chooses another playable species.

| 1d10 | Species |
|:-:|---|
| 1 | Aasimar |
| 2 | Dragonborn |
| 3 | Dwarf |
| 4 | Elf |
| 5 | Gnome |
| 6 | Goliath |
| 7 | Halfling |
| 8 | Human |
| 9 | Orc |
| 10 | Tiefling |

The reincarnated creature makes any choices that a species’ description offers, and the creature recalls its former life. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it loses the traits of its previous species and gains the traits of its new one.

Remove Curse

Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s Attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

Resistance
Abjuration Cantrip (Cleric, Druid)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch

Component: V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a willing creature and choose a damage type: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Radiant, Slashing, or Thunder. When the creature takes damage of the chosen type before the spell ends, the creature reduces the total damage taken by 1d4. A creature can benefit from this spell only once per turn.

Resurrection

Level 7 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric)

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

With a touch, you revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, didn’t die of old age, and wasn’t Undead when it died.

The creature returns to life with all its Hit Points. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to D20 Tests. Every time the target finishes a Long Rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0.

Casting this spell to revive a creature that has been dead for 365 days or longer taxes you. Until you finish a Long Rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have Disadvantage on D20 Tests.

Reverse Gravity

Level 7 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 100 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high Cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area that aren’t anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the Cylinder. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the Cylinder’s top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.

Revivify

Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 300+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature revives with 1 Hit Point. This spell can’t revive a creature that has died of old age, nor does it restore any missing body parts.

Rope Trick

Level 2 Transmutation (Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a segment of rope)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a rope. One end of it hovers upward until the rope hangs perpendicular to the ground or the rope reaches a ceiling. At the rope’s upper end, an Invisible 3-foot-by-5-foot portal opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. That space can be reached by climbing the rope, which can be pulled into or dropped out of it.

The space can hold up to eight Medium or smaller creatures. Attacks, spells, and other effects can’t pass into or out of the space, but creatures inside it can see through the portal. Anything inside the space drops out when the spell ends.
