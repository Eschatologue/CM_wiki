You create an acidic bubble and hurl it at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that sphere must succeed on a Dexterity **Saving Throw** or take 1d6 acid damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

### Blade Ward

*Abjuration cantrip*

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** 1 round

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 3d8) and again at 17th level (3d8 and 4d8).

**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)

You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:
  
- You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.  
- You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.  
- You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.  
- You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an :rsc-action: **Action**.

Any creature in the bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw** or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the :d20-save: **Saving Throw** when it moves into the bonfire's space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn or carried.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

As a :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action** on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:
  
- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.  
- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.  
- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.  
- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate :d20-attack: **Attack Roll** for each beam.

### Elementalism

*Transmutation Cantrip - OneD&D*

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range:

**Beckon Air.** You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.

**Beckon Earth.** You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear inyour handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.

**Beckon Fire.** You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.

**Beckon Water.** You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.

**Sculpt Element.** You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature or an object) for 1 hour.

### Encode Thoughts

*Enchantment cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as *detect thoughts* or *modify memory*), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting *detect thoughts* on the strand has the same effect.)

### Fire Bolt

*Evocation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

### Friends

*Enchantment cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one visible creature within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom :d20-save: **Saving Throw** or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if it isn't a Humanoid, if you're fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on it within the past 24 hours.

The spell ends early if the target takes damage or if you make an :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**, deal damage, or force anyone to make a :d20-save: **Saving Throw**.

### Frostbite

*Evocation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution :d20-save: **Saving Throw**.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

**Range:** Self (5-foot radius)  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 sp)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).

### Guidance
*Divination cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one :d20-check: **Ability Check** of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the :d20-check: **Ability Check**. The spell then ends.

### Gust
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:
  
One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength :d20-save: **Saving Throw** or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.  
You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.  
You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.

### Infestation
*Conjuration cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a living flea)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution :d20-save: **Saving Throw**, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

### Light

**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an :rsc-action: **Action**.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity :d20-save: **Saving Throw** to avoid the spell.

### Lightning Lure
*Evocation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self (15-foot radius)  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a lash of lightning energy that strikes at one creature of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of you.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

### Mage Hand
*Conjuration cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an :rsc-action: **Action**. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your :rsc-action: **Action** to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

### Magic Stone
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a *sling*. If thrown, a pebble has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with a pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the :d20-attack: **Attack Roll**. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.

### Mending
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

### Message
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)  
**Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

### Mind Sliver
*Enchantment cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 round

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence :d20-save: **Saving Throw** or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next :d20-save: **Saving Throw** it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

### Minor Illusion
*Illusion cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The Illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an :rsc-action: **Action** or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an Illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an Illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the Illusion for what it is, the Illusion becomes faint to the creature.

### Mold Earth
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 hour (see below)

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:
  
If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.  
You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.  
If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an :rsc-action: **Action**.

### Poison Spray
*Conjuration cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray toxic mist at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Poison damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d12 when you reach levels 5 (2d12), 11 (3d12), and 17 (4d12).

### Prestidigitation
*Transmutation cantrip*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
  
You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.  
You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.  
You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.  
You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.  
You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.  
You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an :rsc-action: **Action**.

### Primal Savagery

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: **Action**  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Fire damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

### Shillelagh

**Casting Time:** :rsc-bonus-action: **Bonus Action**  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.
