### Telekinesis

*Level 5 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a Magic action on your later turns before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell’s range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save.

Object. You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell’s range.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell’s range.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

### Teleport

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

### This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

---

### The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls 1d100 and consults the Teleportation Outcome table and the explanations after it.

---

### Teleportation Outcome

| Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Permanent circle | — | — | — | 01–00 |
| Linked object | — | — | — | 01–00 |
| Very familiar | 01–05 | 06–13 | 14–24 | 25–00 |
| Seen casually | 01–33 | 34–43 | 44–53 | 54–00 |
| Viewed once or described | 01–43 | 44–53 | 54–73 | 74–00 |
| False destination | 01–50 | 51–00 | — | — |

Familiarity. Here are the meanings of the terms in the table’s Familiarity column:

“Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know.
“Linked object” means you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard’s library.
“Very familiar” is a place you have visited often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
“Seen casually” is a place you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t very familiar.
“Viewed once or described” is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic, or a place you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person’s laboratory in the same city.

***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.

***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended.

### Teleportation Circle

*Level 5 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, M (rare inks worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guildhalls, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles. Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of runes arranged in a particular pattern.

When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the DM. You might learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for 365 days.

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1.

You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you’re in.

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. The creature shape-shifts into a different creature or a nonmagical object, or the object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried). The transformation lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration on this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until dispelled.

An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.

Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating equal to or less than the target’s Challenge Rating or level. The target’s game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and personality.

---

### The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the new form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

---

### The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.

---

### The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

Object into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s size and the creature has a Challenge Rating of 9 or lower. The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. In combat, it takes its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your commands.

If the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer control the creature. It might remain Friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.

Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object’s size is no larger than the creature’s size. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form after the spell ends and it returns to normal.

***Cantrip Upgrade.***Whether you deal Radiant damage or the weapon’s normal damage type, the attack deals extra Radiant damage when you reach levels 5 (1d6), 11 (2d6), and 17 (3d6).
