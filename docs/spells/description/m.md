*Level 1 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor. Until the spell ends, the target’s base AC becomes 13 plus its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends early if the target dons armor.

### Mage Hand
Conjuration Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

When you cast the spell, you can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.

As a Magic action on your later turns, you can control the hand thus again. As part of that action, you can move the hand up to 30 feet.

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

### Magic Circle

*Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

The creature can’t willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.
Targets within the Cylinder can’t be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened condition from the creature.
Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.

### Magic Jar

*Level 6 Necromancy (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, or reliquary worth 500+ GP)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell’s Material component. While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a Humanoid’s body.

You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul enters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a successful save, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can’t move and it is Incapacitated.

While possessing a body, you can take a Magic action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

### Magic Missile

*Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.

---

### Magic Mouth

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range—a message that is uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the message, which must be 25 words or fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there, so the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

### Magic Weapon

*Level 2 Transmutation (Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls. The spell ends early if you cast it again.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The bonus increases to +2 with a level 3–5 spell slot. The bonus increases to +3 with a level 6+ spell slot.

---

### Major Image

*Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can’t deal damage or cause conditions.

If you are within range of the illusion, you can take a Magic action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

### Mass Cure Wounds

*Level 5 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each target regains Hit Points equal to 5d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The healing increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.

---

### Mass Heal

*Level 9 Abjuration (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A flood of healing energy flows from you into creatures around you. You restore up to 700 Hit Points, divided as you choose among any number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell also have the Blinded, Deafened, and Poisoned conditions removed from them.

---

### Mass Healing Word

*Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain Hit Points equal to 2d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The healing increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 3.

---

### Mass Suggestion

*Level 6 Enchantment (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity—described in no more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures you can see within range that can hear and understand you. The suggestion must sound achievable and not involve anything that would obviously deal damage to any of the targets or their allies. For example, you could say, “Walk to the village down that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in an hour.”

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can continue for the entire duration, but if the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends for a target upon completing it.

***Using a Higher-*Level Spell Slot.*** The duration is longer with a spell slot of level 7 (10 days), 8 (30 days), or 9 (366 days)*.

---

### Maze

*Level 8 Conjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

---

### Meld into Stone

*Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, merging yourself and your equipment with the stone for the duration. You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

While merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered and have the Prone condition.

---

### Mending

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can’t restore magic to such an object.

---

### Message

*Transmutation Cantrip (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a copper wire)  
**Duration:** 1 round

You point toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.

---

### Meteor Swarm

*Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 1 mile  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area, and the object starts burning if it’s flammable.

---

### Mind Blank

*Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even Wish—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

---

### Minor Illusion

*Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again.

If a creature takes a Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

Sound. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

Image. If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

---

### Mirage Arcane

*Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Sight  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area disappears immediately.

Creatures with Truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.

---

### Mirror Image

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real.

Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.

---

### Mislead

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You gain the Invisible condition at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

As a Magic action, you can move the illusory double up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is intangible and invulnerable.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is.

---

### Misty Step

*Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

---

### Modify Memory

*Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed condition for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the target also has the Incapacitated condition and is unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s details, or create a memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you finish describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as a false memory of how much the creature enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature.

A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can alter the target’s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any time in the creature’s past (level 9 spell slot)*.

---

### Moonbeam

*Level 2 Evocation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell’s area moves into its space and when it enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

### Move Earth

*Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature shovel)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.

This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.
