### Legend Lore

*Level 5 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth 250+ GP, which the spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth 50+ GP each)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a famous person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about that famous thing, as described by the DM.

The lore might consist of important details, amusing revelations, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. The more information you already know about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. That information is accurate but might be couched in figurative language or poetry, as determined by the DM.

If the famous thing you chose isn't actually famous, you hear sad musical notes played on a trombone, and the spell fails.

### Levitate

*Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a metal spring)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically up to 20 feet and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate an object that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can take a Magic action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lighting bolt.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.
