# Spell (A)

---

#### Absorb Elements

*Level 1 Abjuration (Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** 1 round

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

---

### Acid Splash

*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create an acidic bubble at a point within range, where it explodes in a 5-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that Sphere must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 Acid damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach levels 5 (2d6), 11 (3d6), and 17 (4d6).

---

### Aid
*Level 2 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Each target's Hit Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

---

### Alarm
*Level 1 Abjuration (Ranger, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:

Audible Alarm. The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area.

Mental Alarm. You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

---

### Alter Self
*Level 2 Transmutation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a Magic action to change your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength.

### Animal Friendship
*Level 1 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

Target a Beast that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. If you or one of your allies deals damage to the target, the spells ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional Beast for each spell slot level above 1.

---

### Animal Messenger
*Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)  
**Duration:** 24 hours

A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the target's Challenge Rating isn't 0, it automatically succeeds). You specify a location you have visited and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the duration toward the specified location, covering about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast can fly.

When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, mimicking your communication. If the Beast doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The spell's duration increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level above 2.

---

### Animal Shapes
*Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 24 hours

Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a different form for each target. On later turns, you can take a Magic action to transform the targets again.

A target's game statistics are replaced by the chosen Beast's statistics, but the target retains its creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target's actions are limited by the Beast form's anatomy, and it can't cast spells. The target's equipment melds into the new form, and the target can't use any of that equipment while in that form.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Beast form's Hit Points. The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, until the target has no Temporary Hit Points, or until the target leaves the form as a Bonus Action.

---

### Animate Dead
*Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes an Undead creature: a Skeleton if you chose bones or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (see appendix B for the stat blocks).

On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new creature.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

---

### Animate Objects
*Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects animate at your command. Choose a number of nonmagical objects within range that aren't being worn or carried, aren't fixed to a surface, and aren't Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge target counts as three.

Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes a Construct that uses the Animated Object stat block; this creature is under your control until the spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each creature you make with this spell is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative count and takes its turn immediately after yours.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. When the creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it reverts to its object form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The creature's Slam damage increases by 1d4 (Medium or smaller), 1d6 (Large), or 1d12 (Huge) for each spell slot level above 5.

### Antilife Shell
*Level 5 Abjuration (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura extends from you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.

---

### Antimagic Field
*Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (iron filings)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Emanation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions, or create other magical effects inside the aura, and those things can't target or otherwise affect anything inside it. Magical properties of magic items don't work inside the aura or on anything inside it.

Areas of effect created by spells or other magic can't extend into the aura, and no one can teleport into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals close temporarily while in the aura.

Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.

Dispel Magic has no effect on the aura, and the auras created by different Antimagic Field spells don't nullify each other.

---

### Antipathy/Sympathy
*Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)  
**Duration:** 10 days

As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save:

Antipathy. The creature has the Frightened condition. The Frightened creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route.

Sympathy. The creature has the Charmed condition. The Charmed creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.

Ending the Effect. If the Frightened or Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again.

---

### Arcane Eye
*Level 4 Divination (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an Invisible, invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

---

### Arcane Lock
*Level 2 Abjuration (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, container, or hatch and magically lock it for the duration. This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means. You and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open and close the object despite the lock. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, unlocks it for 1 minute.

---

### Astral Projection
*Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (for each of the spell's targets, one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell ends instantly if you are already on that plane). Each target's body is left behind in a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't need food or air, and doesn't age.

A target's astral form resembles its body in almost every way, replicating its game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only when an effect states that it does so—the target's body and astral form both die.

A target's astral form can travel through the Astral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that plane, the target's body and possessions travel along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter its body on the new plane.

Any damage or other effects that apply to an astral form have no effect on the target's body and vice versa. If a target's body or astral form drops to 0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to dismiss it.

When the spell ends for a target who isn't dead, the target reappears in its body and exits the state of suspended animation.

### Augury
*Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, cards, or other divinatory tokens worth 25+ GP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses the omen from the Omens table.

Omens
| Omen | For Results That Will Be... |
|---|---|
| Weal | Good |
| Woe | Bad |
| Weal and woe | Good and bad |
| Indifference | Neither good nor bad |
| The spell doesn't account for circumstances, such as other spells, that might change the results. |  |


If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

---

### Aura of Life
*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have Resistance to Necrotic damage, and your Hit Point maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 Hit Points starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 Hit Point.

---

### Awaken
*Level 5 Transmutation (Bard, Druid)*

**Casting Time:** 8 hours  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the Awakened Shrub or Awakened Tree in the Monster Manual.

The awakened target has the Charmed condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you.
