### Scrying

*Level 5 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth 1,000+ GP, such as a crystal ball, mirror, or water-filled font)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified (see the tables below) by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. The target doesn't know what it is making the save against, only that it feels uneasy.

| Your Knowledge of the Target Is... | Save Modifier |
|---|:-:|
| Secondhand (heard of the target) | +5 |
| Firsthand (met the target) | +0 |
| Extensive (know the target well) | −5 |

| You Have the Target's... | Save Modifier |
|---|:-:|
| Picture or other likeness | −2 |
| Garment or other possession | −4 |
| Body part, lock of hair, or bit of nail | −10 |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this spell on it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an Invisible, intangible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. If something can see the sensor, it appears as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can target a location you have seen. When you do so, the sensor appears at that location and doesn't move.

*Level 1 Evocation*
  
**Casting Time:** :rsc-bonus-action: Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a target with a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you hit the target, it takes an extra 1d6 Fire damage from the attack. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target takes 1d6 Fire damage and then makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell continues. On a successful save, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** All the damage increased by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc)

### Seeming

*Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.

A creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

### Sending

*Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action

**Components:** V, S, M (a copper wire)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send a short message of 25 words or fewer to a creature you have met or a creature described to you by someone who has met it. The target hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables targets to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. You know if the delivery fails.

Upon receiving your message, a creature can block your ability to reach it again with this spell for 8 hours. If you try to send another message during that time, you learn that you are blocked, and the spell fails.

### Sequester

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.

If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

---

### Shapechange

*Level 9 Transmutation (Druid, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a Magic action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a Challenge Rating no higher than your level or Challenge Rating. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you shape-shift, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the form. The spell ends early if you have no Temporary Hit Points left.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

*Transmutation Cantrip (Druid)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).

The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  

The target hit by the strike takes an extra 2d6 Radiant damage from the attack. If the target has the Invisible condition, that condition ends on it.

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the Sphere has Immunity to Thunder damage, and creatures have the Deafened condition while entirely inside it.

### Silent Image

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

As a Magic action, you can cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

### Simulacrum

*Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 12 hours  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum is half as much, and it can't cast this spell.

The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short or Long Rests.

If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a Long Rest, during which you expend components worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.

The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed.

If the target fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have Immunity to the Exhaustion condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

### Sorcerous Burst

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage. If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll another d8, and add it to the damage. Whenever you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier. You choose the damage type each time you cast this spell: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach level 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

**Duration:** 10 minutes

*Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer questions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the past 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.

---

### Speak with Plants

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You imbue plants in an immobile 30-foot Emanation with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn Difficult Terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.

The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can move their branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.

If a Plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language.

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom (Perception or Survival) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

---

### Spirit Guardians

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice.

When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is explained below.

***Set the Trigger.*** You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, common triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, or approaching within a certain distance of it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common triggers include opening that object or seeing the glyph.

You can refine the trigger so that only creatures of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.

Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.

***Death.*** Each target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful save.

***Discord.*** Each target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Fear.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened, the target must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

***Pain.*** Each target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the Incapacitated condition for 1 minute.

***Sleep.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Unconscious condition for 10 minutes. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake it awake.

***Stunning.*** Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition for 1 minute.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its :d20-attack: **Attack Rolls** and :d20-check: **Ability Checks**, as well as its Constitution :d20-save: **Saving Throws** to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence :d20-save: **Saving Throw** at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
