### Cosmic Flare

*Conjuration Cantrip (Druid, Wizard, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You summon a fragment of the heart from a distant star, and hurl it toward a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Radiant damage and becomes seared with a star radiance. The next time the seared target is hit by an attack roll before the start of your next turn, it takes an extra 1d4 Radiant damage as the lingering energy erupts.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The spell creates two projectiles at level 5, three projectiles at level 11, and four projectiles at level 17. You can hurl the projectiles at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each projectiles.

> *The spell earned its name when a Spire first laid its gaze upon a mortal, granting them permission to draw power from the lingering energy of Antares' now shattered moon. However, a particularly self-centered elf insists on calling it "Khaine’s Kalamity"—because it has a much cooler ring to it and makes for a better story at parties.*
