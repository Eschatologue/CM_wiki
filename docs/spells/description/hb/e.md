### Esch's Steel Wind Strike

*Level 2 Conjuration (Ranger, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least 1 SP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You sheathes the weapon used in the spellcasting, vanish, then appear to strike at multiple location in an instant. Choose up to two creatures you can see within range. Make a melee weapon attack against each target using the weapon used in casting. On a hit, targets take normal damage of an attack with that weapon plus an additional 1d8 Force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The number of targets increases by one, and the damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
