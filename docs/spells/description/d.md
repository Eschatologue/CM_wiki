### Dancing Lights

*Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-size lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover for the duration. Alternatively, you combine the four lights into one glowing Medium form that is vaguely humanlike. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds Dim Light in a 10-foot radius.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a space within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range.

### Darkness

*Level 2 Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. Darkvision can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

### Darkvision

**Components:** V, S, M (a dried carrot)

### Dark Star

*Level 8 Evocation (Sorcerer (Voidwielder), Wizard (Chronurgy, Graviturgy))*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of onyx and a drop of the caster's blood, both of which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell creates a sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere can have a radius of up to 40 feet. The area within this sphere is filled with magical darkness and crushing gravitational force.

For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

### Daylight

*Level 3 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is Bright Light and sheds Dim Light for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

---

### Death Ward

*Level 4 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death. The first time the target would drop to 0 Hit Points before the spell ends, the target instead drops to 1 Hit Point, and the spell ends.

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantly without dealing damage, that effect is negated against the target, and the spell ends.

---

### Delayed Blast Fireball

*Level 7 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The spell's base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended.

If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren't being worn or carried start burning.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.

### Demiplane

*Level 8 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy Medium door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. This door can be opened and closed, and it leads to a demiplane that is an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone (your choice).

When the spell ends, the door vanishes, and any objects inside the demiplane remain there. Any creatures inside also remain unless they opt to be shunted through the door as it vanishes, landing with the Prone condition in the unoccupied spaces closest to the door's former space.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane or connect the shadowy door to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, you can connect the shadowy door to that demiplane instead.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

### Detect Thoughts

*Level 2 Divination (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (1 Copper Piece)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You activate one of the effects below. Until the spell ends, you can activate either effect as a Magic action on your later turns.

Sense Thoughts. You sense the presence of thoughts within 30 feet of yourself that belong to creatures that know languages or are telepathic. You don't read the thoughts, but you know that a thinking creature is present.

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

Read Thoughts. Target one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself or one creature within 30 feet of yourself that you detected with the Sense Thoughts option. You learn what is most on the target's mind right now. If the target doesn't know any languages and isn't telepathic, you learn nothing.

As a Magic action on your next turn, you can try to probe deeper into the target's mind. If you probe deeper, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you discern the target's reasoning, emotions, and something that looms large in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and until you shift your attention away from the target's mind, the target can take an action on its turn to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC, ending the spell on a success.

### Dimension Door

*Level 4 Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 500 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport to a location within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “300 feet upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle.”

You can also teleport one willing creature. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you teleport, and it teleports to a space within 5 feet of your destination space.

If you, the other creature, or both would arrive in a space occupied by a creature or completely filled by one or more objects, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 Force damage, and the teleportation fails.

### Disguise Self

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armour, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by Wall of Force.

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a True Resurrection or a Wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you use.

**Casting Time:** Action or Ritual  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word imbued with power from the Upper Planes. Each creature of your choice in range makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a target that has 50 Hit Points or fewer suffers an effect based on its current Hit Points, as shown in the Divine Word Effects table. Regardless of its Hit Points, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend target that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn't there already) and can't return to the current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a Wish spell.

##### Divine Word Effects

|---|---|
| 0–20 | The target dies. |
| 21–30 | The target has the Blinded, Deafened, and Stunned conditions for 1 hour. |

You have a telepathic link with the Charmed target while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to the target (no action required), such as “Attack that creature,” “Move over there,” or “Fetch that object.” The target does its best to obey on its turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.

You target a creature you know on the same plane of existence. You or a willing creature you touch enters a trance state to act as a dream messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is Incapacitated and has a Speed of 0.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the spell's duration. The messenger can also shape the dream's environment, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the spell. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking.

If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to sleep, at which point the messenger enters its dreams.

You can make the messenger terrifying to the target. If you do so, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words, and then the target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and it takes 3d6 Psychic damage when it wakes up.
