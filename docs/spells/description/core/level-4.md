### Control Water
*Level 4 Transmutation*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 300 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any water inside an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on a side, using one of the following effects. As a **:rsc-a: Magic**{ .rsc } action on your later turns, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

***Part Water.*** You part water in the area and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.

***Whirlpool.*** You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirlpool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature can swim away from the whirlpool only if it first takes an action to pull away and succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

The target has **:d20-adv: Advantage**{ .d20 } on the save if you or your allies are fighting it. Whenever the target takes damage, it repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

You have a telepathic link with the Charmed target while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. On your turn, you can use this link to issue commands to the target (no action required), such as "Attack that creature," "Move over there," or "Fetch that object." The target does its best to obey on its turn. If it completes an order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it acts and moves as it likes, focusing on protecting itself.

You can command the target to take a **:rsc-r: Reaction**{ .rsc } but must take your own Reaction to do so.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Your Concentration can last longer with a spell slot of level 5 (up to 10 minutes), 6 (up to 1 hour), or 7+ (up to 8 hours).

### Hallucinatory Terrain
*Level 4 Illusion*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** 300 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a mushroom)   
**Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn) if you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as under the effects of a *Flesh to Stone* or *Polymorph* spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.

This spell can't locate a creature if any thickness of lead blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

**Range:** 120 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead)   
**Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a Cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any of the following properties:

- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.
- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including Darkvision) through it.
- Sensors created by Divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.
- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by Divination spells.
- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.

Casting this spell on the same spot every day for 365 days makes the spell last until dispelled.

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a glass sphere)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A shimmering sphere encloses a Large or smaller creature or object within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.

The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can take an action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's Speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.

A *Disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside.

The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice.

The target gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the Hit Points of the Beast form. The spell ends early on the target if it has no Temporary Hit Points left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

### Summon Greater Demon

**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll Initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.

At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

### Watery Sphere
*Level 4 Conjuration*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet   
**Components:** V, S, M (a droplet of water)   
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.

Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.
