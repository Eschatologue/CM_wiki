### Earthquake

*Level 8 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 500 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a fractured rock)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point. The ground there is Difficult Terrain.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each of your turns for the duration, each creature on the ground in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the Prone condition, and its Concentration is broken.

You can also cause the effects below.

***Fissures.*** A total of 1d6 fissures open in the spell’s area at the end of the turn you cast it. You choose the fissures’ locations, which can’t be under structures. Each fissure is 1d10 × 10 feet deep and 10 feet wide, and it extends from one edge of the spell’s area to another edge. A creature in the same space as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses.

A creature within a distance from a collapsing structure equal to half the structure’s height makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the Prone condition, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  

You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range:

**Beckon Air.** You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.

**Beckon Earth.** You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear inyour handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.

**Beckon Fire.** You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.

**Beckon Water.** You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.

**Sculpt Element.** You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature or an object) for 1 hour.

### Enhance Ability

*Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather)

### Enlarge/Reduce

*Level 2 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

***Enlarge.*** The target’s size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

***Reduce.*** The target’s size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has Disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target’s attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal 1d4 less damage on a hit (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into Difficult Terrain. They disappear when the spell ends.
 
Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer Restrained by them.

### Etherealness

*Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can perceive the plane you left, which looks gray, and you can’t see anything there more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can affect and be affected only by creatures, objects, and effects on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive or interact with you unless a feature gives them the ability to do so.

When the spell ends, you return to the plane you left in the spot that corresponds to your space in the Border Ethereal. If you appear in an occupied space, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take Force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell ends instantly if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target up to three willing creatures (including yourself) for each spell slot level above 7. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to target another creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.

***Asleep.*** The target has the Unconscious condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Panicked.*** The target has the Frightened condition. On each of its turns, the Frightened target must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can’t see you, this effect ends.

***Sickened.*** The target has the Poisoned condition.
