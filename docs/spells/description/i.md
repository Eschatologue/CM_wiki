# Spells (I)

### Ice Storm

*Level 4 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 300 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a mitten)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the Cylinder makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 Bludgeoning damage and 4d6 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the Cylinder into Difficult Terrain until the end of your next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Bludgeoning damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 4.

### Identify

*Level 1 Divination (Bard, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth 100+ GP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires Attunement, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

### Illusory Script

*Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute or Ritual  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** S, M (ink worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or another suitable material and imbue it with an illusion that lasts for the duration. To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the writing appears normal, seems to be written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, the illusion can alter the meaning, handwriting, and language of the text, though the language must be one you know.

If the spell is dispelled, the original script and the illusion both disappear.

A creature that has Truesight can read the hidden message.

### Immovable Object

*Level 2 Transmutation (Wizard (Chronurgy, Graviturgy))*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds and cause it to become magically fixed in place. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can move the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute.

If the object is fixed in the air, it can hold up to 4,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the object to fall. Otherwise, a creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can move the object up to 10 feet.***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or 5th level, the DC to move the object increases by 5, it can carry up to 8,000 pounds of weight, and the duration increases to 24 hours. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the DC to move the object increases by 10, it can carry up to 20,000 pounds of weight, and the effect is permanent until dispelled.

### Imprisonment

*Level 9 Abjuration (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of the target worth 5,000+ GP)  
**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target is unaffected, and it is immune to this spell for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the target is imprisoned. While imprisoned, the target doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive the imprisoned target, and the target can't teleport.

Until the spell ends, the target is also affected by one of the following effects of your choice:

Burial. The target is entombed beneath the earth in a hollow globe of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass into or out of the globe.

Chaining. Chains firmly rooted in the ground hold the target in place. The target has the Restrained condition and can't be moved by any means.

Hedged Prison. The target is trapped in a demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane is your choice of a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or the like.

Minimus Containment. The target becomes 1 inch tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gemstone or a similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through by any means.

Slumber. The target has the Unconscious condition and can't be awoken.

Ending the Spell. When you cast the spell, specify a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as simple or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that it has a high likelihood of happening within the next decade. The trigger must be an observable action, such as someone making a particular offering at the temple of your god, saving your true love, or defeating a specific monster.

A Dispel Magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the prison or the component used to create it.

### Incendiary Cloud

*Level 8 Conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d8 Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.

### Inflict Wounds

*Level 1 Necromancy (Cleric)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d10 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Insect Plague

*Level 5 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** 300 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a locust)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.

### Invisibility

*Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash in gum arabic)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
