*Level 3 Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.

### Vitriolic Sphere

**Casting Time:** :rsc-action: Action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a :d20-save: Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 acid damage and another 5d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The initial damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above 4.
