# Welcome!

Welcome to the new wiki page for Crown and Misery, the world's most casual, *family-friendly* D&D campaign, created by a fan of challenging and morally ambiguous stories. Set in a super-continent named Antares, a beautiful and ethereal land laden with *war*, *death*, and *destruction*, this campaign is brought to you by the DM's coffee-induced, self-hatred-fueled writing extravaganza.

## Why Did I Create This Wiki?

A year ago, I swore to myself that I would never touch anything related to GitHub or coding in general. Modding a game had already consumed the majority of my limited free time, offering no tangible benefits for the degree I was pursuing. Then, a good friend introduced me to Dungeons & Dragons, and my time was redirected from game modding to D&D. This eventually led me to create my own campaign and, inevitably, dragged me back into the dark arts of coding, which I had vowed to avoid. And thus, here we are, with this wiki as the latest product of my descent into the abyss.

## Important Disclaimer

This site is a non-commercial fan resource for a private Dungeons & Dragons campaign set in an original world and lore created by me, the Dungeon Master.

While the campaign uses the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition system as a framework (including rules and classes like Artificer), all lore, world-building, and narrative content is my own intellectual property and not affiliated with or endorsed by Wizards of the Coast.

Content linked here (such as from D&D Beyond) is for reference purposes only. This site is for the private use of my gaming group and is not for profit.

All Dungeons & Dragons content (rules, mechanics, etc.) remains the property of Wizards of the Coast.

Some content on this site is adapted from other homebrew creators, because their stuff is amazing and I wanted to use it in my game. Credit is given where due. This is a personal project not meant for public distribution â€” if you're seeing this and you're not one of my players... how did you even get here?
