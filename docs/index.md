# Welcome!

Welcome to the new wiki page for Crown and Misery, the world's most casual, *family-friendly* D&D campaign, created by a fan of challenging and morally ambiguous stories. Set in a super-continent named Antares, a beautiful and ethereal land laden with *war*, *death*, and *destruction*, this campaign is brought to you by the DM's coffee-induced, self-hatred-fueled writing extravaganza.

## Why Did I Create This Wiki?

A year ago, I swore to myself that I would never touch anything related to GitHub or coding in general. Modding a game had already consumed the majority of my limited free time, offering no tangible benefits for the degree I was pursuing. Then, a good friend introduced me to Dungeons & Dragons, and my time was redirected from game modding to D&D. This eventually led me to create my own campaign and, inevitably, dragged me back into the dark arts of coding, which I had vowed to avoid. And thus, here we are, with this wiki as the latest product of my descent into the abyss.
