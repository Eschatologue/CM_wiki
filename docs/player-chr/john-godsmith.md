# Path of the Finality

*You stand as the last remnant of a lineage that has long  perished—a relic from an old world, the descendants of those erased from history. As this world approaches its end, your story is just beginning. Questions beg answers, and loose ends yearn to be tied. Your name, your family, and your tribe all converge at a singular point in history—a history the Spires played a part in erasing. What secrets lie beyond the stars? What mysteries rest beneath this continent? And what awaits at the journey's end?*

*“May your blade be swift, your judgment just, and your decisions resolute.”*

## 1st Level: Cold Rage

You've witnessed the ravages of unbridled anger, the toll it takes on the innocent and the cherished. But you are different; even the mightiest of flames can be tamed.

When you use your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage**, instead of flying into a primal ferocity, you instead fall into a chilling silence, your eyes void of all emotion as you prepare to cut through everything with ruthless precision.

## 3rd level: Primordial Conflagration

You have the ability to channel the lethal repercussion of speaking Celestial to your advantage, allowing you to use the curse put on by the heavens to smite your foes!

Whenever you activate your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage**, or once as a **Bonus Action** while :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Raging** you can roll an amount of :material-dice-d12: d12 up to your Constitution modifier. You expend Hit Points equal to the result and enhance your attacks with Primordial Flare for the :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** duration.

While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack that benefits from your **Rage** damage, the weapon's damage type changes to :material-fire: Fire damage and it deals an extra :material-fire: 1d8 Fire damage for each :material-dice-d12: d12 you roll.

## 3rd level: Improved Totemic Spirit

Choose one of the animal spirits from the list below or from the original list to gain its benefits.

=== "**Bear**"
    The resilient spirit of the Bear increases your ability to take physical hits. 

    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, you gain resistance to all types of damage except Force and Psychic damage and you have immunity to Fire damage.

=== "**Eagle**" 
    
    The fierce spirit of the Eagle grants you the ability to move fast as the wind. 

    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, you can use a :material-square: **Bonus Action** to gain the benefits of the Dash or Disengage action, including the :material-square: **Bonus Action** that you use to enter a :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage**.
    - When you make a successful ranged attack with a thrown weapon using Strength, you can add your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** Damage bonus to the attack's damage roll.

=== "**Elk**" 

    The noble spirit of the Elk makes you extraordinarily swift. 

    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, your walking speed increases by 15 feet.
    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, opportunity attack against you is made with a disadvantage and difficult terrain does not affect you.

=== "**Elephant**"

    The spirit of the Elephant lends you its resilience. 

    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, when you are forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, you use your :material-star-four-points: **Reaction** to add your Constitution modifier to the saving throw. You also can not be moved against your will.
    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack using Strength, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.

=== "**Wolf**"
    
    The cunni spirit of the Wolf enhances your ability to fight alongside your pack. 

    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, allied creatures of your choice have advantage on any melee attack roll they make against hostile creatures within 10 feet of you.
    - While your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage** is active, the first creature you hit with an attack on your turn has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of your next turn.

## 5th level: Flames of Creation

*In the beginning there was a Fire of Creation. In the end the same flames will rend the world asunder and brought upon new beginning.*

When an attack dealing Fire damage from *Path of Finality* special class features reduces a creature to 0 hit points, you restore Hit Points equal to half of any excess damage from that attack.
