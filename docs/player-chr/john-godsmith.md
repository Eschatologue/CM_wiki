# Path of the Finality

*You stand as the last remnant of a lineage that has long  perished—a relic from an old world, the descendants of those erased from history. As this world approaches its end, your story is just beginning. Questions beg answers, and loose ends yearn to be tied. Your name, your family, and your tribe all converge at a singular point in history—a history the Spires played a part in erasing. What secrets lie beyond the stars? What mysteries rest beneath this continent? And what awaits at the journey's end?*

*“May your blade be swift, your judgment just, and your decisions resolute.”*

## 1st Level: Cold Rage

You've witnessed the ravages of unbridled anger, the toll it takes on the innocent and the cherished. But you are different; even the mightiest of flames can be tamed.

When you use your :fontawesome-solid-hand-fist: **Rage**, instead of flying into a primal ferocity, you instead fall into a chilling silence, your eyes void of all emotion as you prepare to cut through everything with ruthless precision.

## 3rd level: Primordial Conflagration

You have the ability to channel the lethal repercussion of speaking Celestial to your advantage, allowing you to use the curse put on by the heavens to smite your foes!

Whenever you activate your **Rage**, or once as a **Bonus Action** while **Raging** you can roll an amount of :material-dice-d12: d12 up to your Constitution modifier. You take necrotic damage equal to the result and enhance your attacks with Primordial Flare for the **Rage** duration.

While your **Rage** is active, whenever you hit a creature with a weapon attack that benefits from your **Rage** damage, the weapon's damage type changes to Fire damage and it deals an extra 1d8 Fire damage for each :material-dice-d12: d12 you roll.


## 5th level: Flames of Eridu



This Fire damage ignores the target’s resistance, and you treat immunities as resistance. Moreover, you treat celestial-type creature as if they are vulnerable. Even if the fire damage changes to a different type through magic items or class features, it retains these benefits.
