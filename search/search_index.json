Alignment An alignment is suggested for the monster, with the DM determining its actual alignment. AC, Initiative, and HP These entries give the monster's Armour Class,   Initiative, and Hit Points, which are detailed in chapter 1. In parentheses after the Hit Points, the monster's Hit Point Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its Constitution, if any, to its Hit Points. Following the   Initiative modifier is an   Initiative score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and   Initiative information.

Reactions If the monster can take special Reactions, those are listed in this section. Attack Notation The entry for a monster's attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. Saving Throw Effect Notation If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of saving throw required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save. Damage Notation A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit.

Kingdoms fell, gods grew silent, and knowledge was scattered to the winds. In this broken world, survival depends not on tradition but on adaptation. Magic, martial arts, divine pacts, and ancient relics have been salvaged, mixed, and reforged into new forms.</p> <p>In Antares, power is not bound by rigid disciplines. It is stolen, traded, rediscovered, and repurposed. A Fighter may forge pacts with eldritch entities, a Wizard might wield firearms, a Druid could shape metal as easily as flesh, and Clerics may draw power from cosmic aberrations. This is not creativity\u2014it\u2019s survival.</p> <p>The lines between classes have blurred beyond recognition. Techniques, feats, and magics from across time and culture now coexist because the world demands it. In Antares, pragmatism often outweighs tradition.</p>"},{"location":"class/#player-character-classes","title":"Player Character Classes","text":"<p>Due to the nature of Antares, many traditional class identities have shifted, with only their mechanics remaining relatively intact. These changes are largely a reflection of the world\u2019s new reality.</p> <p>Artificers Once a subdiscipline of wizardry, artificers have forged their own identity in the wake of the Warp. Artifice is a fledgling but rapidly growing field, blending Gallian arcana with Albion\u2019s emerging technology. These so-called Technomancers manipulate machines with magic, crafting constructs, tools, and weapons infused with arcane precision. Though some embrace the nickname, \u201cArtificer\u201d remains the preferred title\u2014one that honors their philosophy of shaping the world through innovation.</p> <p>Barbarians Barbarians once roamed the untamed wilds\u2014but in the age of the Citadel Cities, many live in plain sight. Farmhands, drifters, mercenaries\u2014they blend in, until the moment the Warp rises and the city burns. Then their fury awakens, a primal force not just of nature, but of defiance. Their rage is no longer born only of survival, but of alienation, trauma, and the pressure of a world unraveling.</p> <p>Bards(.inl) Bards are keepers of songs and tales\u2014and writers of new ones. Their magic flows from performance, emotion, and the raw, resonant power of story. They often masquerade as historians, liars, prophets, and rebels\u2014sometimes all at once. Bards ensure the stories, legacies, and songs of this world are remembered for centuries to come.</p> <p>Clerics Clerics draw power not from gods, but from the Spires\u2014cosmic forces that shape reality itself with abstract philosophies like Destruction, Harmony, or Judgement. Clerics interpret these Spires through personal or collective belief. One may see Destruction as renewal; another, as pure ruin. Their chosen Domain reflects how they embody their Spire's truth.</p> <p>Druids Druids are more than nature\u2019s guardians\u2014they are the voice of the world, whether that world is a blooming forest, a toxic industrial sprawl, or the silence between stars. Some still commune with the wilds; others draw magic from decaying cities, celestial alignments, or the whisper of machines. Whatever their origin, druids shape their power to reflect the landscape they serve\u2014or the one they fight to reclaim.</p> <p>Fighters Combat is survival in Antares. Fighters are the most common warriors\u2014some pure martial artists, others augmented by magic, psionics, or strange pacts. There are no heroes without weapons, no victories without violence. Whether through raw strength, tactical brilliance, or unnatural adaptability, Fighters are the backbone of resistance in a collapsing world.</p> <p>Magus The Magus is the living fusion of blade and spell. Drawn from ancient orders\u2014many of Gallian origin\u2014they wield arcane power and martial prowess as one. Some Magi defend with protective wards; others strike down enemies with explosive power. Wherever they go, they carry the legacy of magic\u2019s oldest martial traditions, reforged for a world that needs both steel and sorcery.</p> <p>Monks Monks are rare in the age of the Warp. Their monasteries were destroyed or forgotten\u2014but some endure. Hidden in city slums or posing as actors, they continue to train. Others walk as healers, teachers, or quiet defenders of the displaced. Though their traditions have changed, their discipline remains\u2014refined in alleyways and rooftop gardens, where the world\u2019s noise cannot reach them.</p> <p>Paladins Paladin powers comes from conviction\u2014unyielding, inflexible, and absolute. Their Oath is a truth they live so deeply it reshapes the world around them. Vengeance, glory, redemption, honor\u2014whatever the ideal, it becomes their source of power. A paladin is not chosen. A paladin chooses\u2014and that stubbornness becomes divine.</p> <p>Rangers Rangers are survivors. Whether navigating wildlands, ruins, or city depths, they track, scout, and strike with precision. Many work as bounty hunters, guides, or monster-killers. Others act as scouts between the Citadel Cities and the world beyond. Where others see only danger, rangers see patterns, paths, and prey. In a world this broken, they are the ones who know how to walk it.</p> <p>Sorcerers Sorcerers are born, not made. Most are human, often tracing their bloodlines to Gallia, where magical talent was once a mark of social status. Their power is raw and often volatile\u2014but in the right hands, it rivals any scholar\u2019s. Some embrace their chaos; others temper it with discipline or study. But all sorcerers carry a spark that doesn\u2019t come from books\u2014it comes from within.</p> <p>Wizards Wizards are the architects of arcane knowledge. They study, catalogue, and master magic through careful discipline. Gallian academies once dominated the magical world\u2014but the rise of intuitive magic and the spread of wild power has shaken their dominance. Now, many wizards see this as a new age: one of rediscovery, reinvention, and arcane rebellion. The old guard may cling to tradition, but the future belongs to those who rewrite it.</p> <p>Warlocks Warlocks form pacts with beings of immense, mysterious power\u2014dead archmages whose minds still echo, exiled horrors sealed beyond the veil, or entities so alien they barely register as conscious. These patrons are not gods, but they are close enough that the difference hardly matters. The bond is personal, transformative, and dangerous. A warlock doesn\u2019t worship\u2014they survive, they hunger, they reach\u2014and something reaches back.</p>"},{"location":"class/#class-groups","title":"Class Groups","text":"<p>Each class is a part of a Class Group-a set of Classes that have certain features and themes in common.</p>"},{"location":"class/#class-group","title":"Class Group","text":"Group Classes What They're Known For Experts Artificer<sup>TCE</sup>, Bard, Ranger, Rogue Adaptive and polymaths.

Some Sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The touch of a dragon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer's gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.

The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect the source of that magic.</p> <p>Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet.

Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain size\u2014small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that's at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic Missile, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p> <p>Finishing a   Long Rest restores any expended spell slots.</p>"},{"location":"spells/casting-spells/#casting-without-slots","title":"Casting without Slots","text":"<p>There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a spell slot:</p> <p>Cantrips A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.</p> <p>Rituals Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn't expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Ritual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.</p> <p>Special Abilities Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</p> <p>Magic Items Spell Scrolls and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a spell slot.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p> <p>The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:</p> <ul> <li>Object Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.</li> <li>Instant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.</li> <li>Resistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.</li> <li>Spell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.</li> <li>Sudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.</li> <li>Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish spell could undo an ally's failed saving throw or a foe's Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made with   Advantage or   Disadvantage, and you choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.</li> <li>Reshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner. If your wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect a god, the god's divine servants might instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her head, and your wish fails. The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a   Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.</li> </ul> <p>Classes: Sorcerer, Wizard</p>","boost":1.2}]}
